45,"In 1999, the people voted for the National Democratic Alliance."
46,The Bharatiya Janata Party was the largest constituent of the NDA and the single largest party in the Lok Sabha.
47,"Our promise to the people then was encapsulated in the assurance: “Able Leadership, Stable Government”."

79,India did make considerable progress during this period.

83,The Congress Party weakened the bonds of national unity and social harmony for partisan gains.
84,"Allowing itself to be reduced from a great party of the Freedom Movement to a tool in the hands of a family, it sought to reduce the world’s largest democracy to dynastic rule."

86,"And the BJP’s era – the era of nationalist, democratic and development-oriented politics – has begun."
87,India is today a nation once again on the move.

90,"From being a nation of unrealised potential, its policies and performance have helped unleash India’s positive energies."
91,2.3 Atalji’s Leadership: A Source of Immense Pride The BJP is proud that it has given India and the world a leader of the calibre of Shri Vajpayee.
92,"As Prime Minister, he has harnessed the national energy and transformed the national mood."

109,"For the first time, through this joint statement, Pakistan has committed itself to preventing the use of any part of the territory under its control for terrorist activities aimed against India."
110,"If Shri Vajpayee won the hearts of Indians and the admiration of the international community with his firm leadership during the Kargil War, he is repeating the feat now with his earnest pursuit of peace-through-dialogue with Pakistan."

118,"The 2004 general election is also an opportunity for all Indians to reject the grim, feel-pain record of the Congress Party and endorse the feel-good mood generated by the our Government."
119,Every election has a specific context.
120,"According to the BJP, the two main issues of Election 2004 are: good governance and accelerated, all-round development."
121,There is a new type of hunger in India—the tremendous hunger for development.
122,It is especially acute in rural areas and among the urban poor.
123,"They want to free themselves from poverty, backwardness and underdevelopment."

136,"In 2004, we seek a decisive mandate for India."
137,"   Election Manifestoes • 13 Our Basic Mission and Commitments 4.1 Politics as a means to serve the Nation: From modest beginnings, the BJP has grown steadily to emerge as a stable pole of Indian politics."
138,Our growth is rooted in our distinctive ideology and the tireless dedication of millions of our karyakartas throughout the country.
139,"In Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, ably assisted by Shri Lal Krishna Advani, we have a leadership that has guided and inspired our Party for decades."
140,"For the BJP and the fraternal organisations that constitute our extended Nationalist Parivar, politics and power have never been ends in themselves, but a means to serve the people and to contribute to India’s attainment of Param Vaibhav (peaks of glory)."
141,4.2 Strengthening India’s Democracy: The BJP is deeply committed to strengthening India’s democracy and to making its institutions more effective in fulfilling the aspirations of our people.
142,We are proud that our Party has nurtured the best traditions of internal democracy in India’s political class.
143,"In the years to come, we shall continue to broaden the interaction between the Party organization and the people, between the people and their elected representatives, and between the Party and the Government to make governance more dynamic, more responsive and more responsible."
144,"4.3 Integral Humanism: The BJP is proud of its commitment to the philosophy of Integral Humanism, as enunciated by Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya."
145,We believe that development cannot be measured by economic indicators alone.
146,Development must be holistic.
147,"It must fulfil the   14 • Party Document Vol-1 material and non-material needs of all individuals and promote a symbiotic relationship between the individual and society, in which the individual works for society, and society, in turn, cares for the individual."
148,"Development must also keep in mind environmental concerns, local and community traditions, and the quality of life."
149,The BJP believes that economic progress should not be at the cost of family values.
150,"The family constitutes the social unit of stability, welfare, and continuity of cultural traditions."
151,Its importance can never be undermined.
152,Integral Humanism teaches us that our nation too is a family and that India itself is a part of the larger human family.
153,4.4 Cultural Nationalism: The BJP draws its inspiration from the history and civilisation of India.
154,"We believe that Indian nationhood stems from a deep cultural bonding of the people that overrides differences of caste, region, religion and language."
155,"We believe that Cultural Nationalism for which Indianness, Bharatiyata and Hindutva are synonyms – is the basis of our national identity."
156,"Contrary to what its detractors say, and as the Supreme Court itself has decreed, Hindutva is not a religious or exclusivist concept."
157,"It is inclusive, integrative, and abhors any kind of discrimination against any section of the people of India on the basis of their faith."
158,It rejects the idea of a theocratic or denominational state.
159,"It accepts the multi-faith character and other diversities of India, considering them to be a source of strength and not weakness."
160,"It firmly upholds secularism, understood as Sarva Pantha Samabhav (treating all faiths with respect)."
161,"However, the BJP unflinchingly holds that differences in faith cannot challenge the idea of India as One Nation or undermine our millennia-old identity as One People."
162,"This is why, we rejected the two-nation theory on the basis of which our Motherland was tragically partitioned in 1947."
163,"Thus, Cultural Nationalism is the most potent antidote to communalism, divisiveness, and separatism of every kind, and a guarantor of our national unity and national integration."
164,4.5 Ram Mandir in Ayodhya: The BJP reaffirms its commitment to the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya.
165,"As Maryada Purushottam, Ram is an inspiring cultural symbol of India."
166,His birthplace in Ayodhya is   Election Manifestoes • 15 also associated with the religious sentiments of crores of Hindus.
167,The BJP remains committed to its stand that the judiciary’s verdict in this matter should be accepted by all.
168,"However, we believe that dialogue, and a negotiated settlement in an atmosphere of mutual trust and goodwill, are the best way of achieving this goal."
169,The BJP appeals to the religious and social leaders of the Hindu and Muslim communities to speed up the process of dialogue and bring it to an amicable and early fruition.
170,We hope that these efforts will succeed in heralding a new chapter of amity in Hindu-Muslim relations and fortify national integration.
171,"4.6 Religious Freedom, our Core Value: Contrary to the propaganda of the Congress and our other political opponents, Shri Vajpayee’s government has not discriminated against minorities, nor curtailed their religious freedoms in any manner."
172,"In statecraft, we will continue to be wedded to our founding ideal of “Justice for All, Appeasement of None”."
173,"We envision the day when the distinction between “majority” and “minority” disappears in the political field, even while people practise their respective faiths unhindered."
174,"The BJP gives a three-point assurance to minorities: Education, Economic upliftment, and Empowerment."
175,"At the same time, we appeal to them to change their old mindset vis-à-vis the BJP and strengthen the hands of Shri Vajpayee in the coming elections."
176,"4.7 Consensus over Uniform Civil Code: The BJP believes that all laws, including personal laws, must be in accordance with the guarantees available to all citizens under the Indian Constitution."
177,The Constitution calls for the enactment of a Uniform Civil Code.
178,The Supreme Court has reiterated this need.
179,"Therefore, this cannot be seen as an issue of any single political party."
180,The BJP views Uniform Civil Code primarily as an instrument to promote gender justice.
181,We believe that social and political consensus has to be evolved before its enactment.
182,4.8 Swadeshi: The BJP believes that every civilisation has its own innate genius.
183,"We are committed to Swadeshi, the philosophy of India First, and to the path of self-reliance."
184,Swadeshi means faith in   16 • Party Document Vol-1 indigenous institutions and a strong belief that the future of India must be secured by Indians themselves.
185,The BJP believes that India’s goal of achieving a double-digit annual GDP growth rate on a sustainable basis can be achieved principally by mobilizing our own domestic resources.
186,"A strong, efficient and high-growth Indian economy, in which Indian products, services and entrepreneurs dominate the domestic and global markets, is our concept of Swadeshi."
187,This can be achieved by making Indian products and services competitive on both cost and quality.
188,"4.9 Globalisation: The BJP believes that, to reduce the risks and challenges of globalisation and to enhance its opportunities and gains, it is imperative to bridge the current divide between the developing and developed economies."
189,"This divide is enabling the developed nations to secure unfair advantages for themselves in global trade, investments, agriculture and services."
190,"They give huge trade- distorting agricultural subsidies to their own farmers, but object to the legitimate pro-farmer measures by developing countries."
191,The NDA Government has been at the forefront of defending the interests of Indian kisans by bringing about a coalition of developing countries against such unjust practices of developed countries.
192,We did so successfully at the WTO meets in Doha and Cancun.
193,Our Government has also successfully defended India’s case in other matters such as patents.
194,This approach shall continue.
195,"The BJP is of the view that a big shift is taking place in the global economy, and India should be prepared to take advantage of it."
196,"This shift favours low-cost economies over high-cost economies in manufacturing and services, provided the former have sufficient competitive strengths on the counts of cost, quality and technology."
197,The Indian economy is rapidly acquiring these strengths.
198,"The BJP is committed to accelerating this process by further reforming our economy, modernizing our infrastructure, enriching India’s human resources, and augmenting our capabilities in science and technology."
199,This will place our predominantly young population in an advantageous position vis-à-vis many advanced nations in the world that are projected to have a demographic disadvantage   Election Manifestoes • 17 in the coming decades.
200,This is the Swadeshi approach to turning globalisation into an opportunity for India in the 21st century.
201,"4.10 Underpinnings of Our Economic Vision: The BJP believes that India must greatly enhance her economic strength, in order to enhance her national strength and become a Great Power."
202,"Towards this strategic goal, the BJP is committed to ensuring faster economic growth with equity, employment, and social justice."
203,"The underpinnings of our economic vision are: steady enhancement of the productivity of our human and natural resources with the best use of science, technology, management and HRD practices, both modern and traditional; removal of regional and social imbalances; bridging the urban-rural divide; minimizing the gap between the rich and poor; maximizing developmental opportunities for all citizens; and environmental protection."
204,"The BJP believes that, as India moves from being a developing country to a developed one, our economic policy has to have a two-pronged approach: policies to achieve faster economic growth combined with effective welfare measures for the poor."
205,Today the foremost national developmental objective is banishment of poverty by increasing our national wealth.
206,"The surest way to achieve this goal, as Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya had emphasized four decades ago, is: “Work for Every Hand and Water to Every Land”."
207,"Agriculture continues to be the backbone of India’s rural economy, sustaining the livelihood of a majority of our population."
208,"Government policies must, therefore, be geared to encourage domestic savings and directing them into productive, entrepreneurship-promoting and employment-generating investments, especially in agriculture and other areas of the rural economy."
209,The BJP believes that wealth creation should be applauded and encouraged.
210,"However, conspicuous consumption goes against the cultural ethos of India."
211,We are not in favour of selfish advancement of the few.
212,"Rather, the BJP believes in the multiplication of universally accessible entitlements for the majority."
213,The BJP is committed to greater consumer choice.
214,"We believe that the creation of monopolies, both in the public and private sector, are undesirable, except when dictated by national security."
215,"18 • Party Document Vol-1 We believe in a responsible fiscal regime marked by modest deficits, low inflation and a steadily strengthening rupee."
216,4.11 India’s Cultural and Spiritual Heritage: The BJP considers India’s priceless cultural and spiritual heritage to be our intangible national wealth.
217,"It has protected our family system, sustained our national life over the millennia and given India her unique identity in the world."
218,We are proud that all the world’s religions have their footprint in India.
219,We believe that a proper use of our cultural and spiritual resources can greatly aid India’s developmental endeavours because of their enormous power to mobilize people’s energies.
220,"This cultural and spiritual heritage displays immense diversities, which should be cherished and celebrated by all Indians as our common endowment."
221,We consider it to be the bounden duty of the Government and citizens alike to preserve and further augment this wealth of a diverse heritage.
222,"In this context, the BJP applauds the NDA Government’s decision to launch national missions for the preservation of manuscripts, monuments, and other facets of our cultural, artistic and spiritual heritage."
223,"However, a lot more needs to be done, considering the neglect of this crucial aspect of nation- building in the past."
224,   Election Manifestoes • 19 Our Priority Agenda for the Next Five Years (The BJP has suggested specific measures under the following areas for inclusion in the NDA’s Manifesto for Election 2004.)
225,5.1 Defence The BJP has always attached the highest importance to national security.
226,We are proud of the NDA Government’s historic initiatives to strengthen India’s defence capability and preparedness.
227,We commit ourselves to carrying forward the work done in the past five years.
228,"Our priorities will be: speedy implementation of all the ongoing programmes for modernisation, acquisition and capability enhancement; minimizing delays and procedural bottlenecks, which push up costs and cause obsolescence; achieving greater efficiency in defence spending; giving a further boost to indigenisation of defence production and encouragement to private sector participation; and making defence exports a thrust area."
229,"The BJP would also work for further augmentation of welfare measures for ex-servicemen and war widows, creating adequate opportunities for retired officers to contribute to development activities where they can put their skills and training to productive use; and making service in the Armed Forces an attractive career option for the educated Indian youth."
230,"5.2 Internal Security The BJP believes that creating a society free of fear, and ensuring safety and security to all citizens form the cornerstone of good governance."
231,"Our war on terrorism, which has shown   20 • Party Document Vol-1 encouraging results in the past five years, will continue with unflagging determination."
232,"Building on the significant reduction of communal and caste violence in the past five years, we shall work with redoubled zeal to realise our vision of a riot-free India."
233,"The long misrule of the Congress Party weakened India’s internal security apparatus and reduced its capacity to counter jehadi terrorism, left-wing extremism, organised crime, and, in some States, even to maintain law and order."
234,"For the first time since Independence, the NDA Government conducted a comprehensive review of the internal security scenario, started to act on its recommendations and launched a massive programme to modernise our police and paramilitary forces."
235,"The BJP is concerned at the inadequate utilization of the police modernization fund in several States, even though the need for it is glaring."
236,We will work with State Governments for time-bound implementation of this programme with utmost urgency.
237,"We will continue our efforts to build political consensus to enact a Central law, and constitute a federal agency to deal with federal crimes like the Telgi scam, which encompass several States."
238,"We will also work with the States to urgently implement police reforms that would make the police and security forces more people-friendly, more sensitive towards the grievances of the poor, weaker sections of society, and women."
239,"The BJP recognises the growing menace of left-wing extremism, which extends from the Nepal border to Andhra Pradesh, as one of the most serious challenges to India’s internal security."
240,"Overcoming this menace, with the closest possible cooperation among the affected States and the Centre, will be our priority."
241,"Since the fight against Naxalite outfits can be successfully waged primarily by isolating them from local populations, our Government will take further steps to speed up development activities, encourage people’s participation in them, and ensure that their benefits actually reach the poor."
242,"5.3 Jammu & Kashmir The unity of India is not only sacred to the BJP, but also a paramount commitment."
243,"We have always believed that Jammu & Kashmir, including the PoK, is an integral part of India."
244,We   Election Manifestoes • 21 hold that the age of redrawing national boundaries is over.
245,"While recognizing that the Constitution provides for certain transient and temporary provisions for Jammu & Kashmir, we believe that the immediate challenge before the Centre and the State is to involve all sections of society in eliminating terrorism, accelerating economic development and strengthening popular governance that can provide people-friendly administration."
246,The imperative for security operations has to be balanced with respect for human rights.
247,We are committed to ensuring early return of Kashmiri Pandits and other displaced people to their native places.
248,"We believe in balanced development of all the three regions of the State—Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh—without any discrimination against any section of the State’s population."
249,"To ensure this, the BJP is committed to a three-point programme: (a) Autonomous Regional Councils for Jammu and Ladakh with adequate financial and administrative powers; (b) Protection of the original demographic identity of the three regions."
250,(c) Equitable distribution of funds from the Centre.
251,The BJP strongly condemns the recent move by the Government of J&K to introduce a law that discriminates against women marrying outside the State in matters of inheritance rights.

262,5.5 Poverty Alleviation The BJP stands committed to tackling dire poverty on a war footing.
263,The persistence of abject poverty after more than 50 years of Independence is a result of both misrule and the faulty policies followed by the Congress.
264,"In the past six years, the number of Indians living below the poverty line has diminished significantly."
265,"However, an unacceptably large number of our citizens are so steeped in poverty that they are unable to reap the full benefits of India’s march forward, or to contribute their fullest to it."
266,"We shall wipe out the problems of poverty and backwardness by mounting a five-pronged attack: 5.5.1 By policies aimed at fully harnessing India’s productive potential and creating national wealth; 5.5.2 By policies that ensure distributive justice by expanding the basket of opportunities for all; 5.5.3 By policies that direct greater governmental investment and incentivise more private investment in backward and rural areas; 5.5.4 By policies and programmes that bring vibrancy to the rural economy, expand and deepen rural markets, and thus create large-scale employment and self-employment opportunities locally."

269,"5.6 Second Green Revolution The route to agricultural prosperity and rural regeneration lies in scientific management of water, land and bio resources, and better linkages with both domestic and export markets."
270,Our vision has three objectives: (a) Indian agriculture should meet the growing domestic demand; (b) it should emerge as an important global player; and (c) agriculture should become remunerative even to small farmers with shrinking landholdings.
271,The first Green Revolution enabled India to achieve self- sufficiency in food.
272,"However, it did not address many critical problems in agriculture and food economy."
273,"The BJP believes that a Second Green Revolution is needed to increase farm productivity, achieve crop diversification, reduce waste and add value at every stage in the food chain linking the kisan to the consumer."
274,"Towards this end, we will continue to give a boost to dairy, poultry and other food-processing industries."
275,"We will promote horticulture, floriculture, sericulture, and cultivation of bio-fuels, medicinal plants and bamboo in a big way."
276,We will take up crop insurance scheme and the newly launched farm income insurance scheme for effective and large- scale implementation.
277,"Comprehensive reform of agricultural markets; free movement of agricultural goods throughout the country; setting up of cold storages, godowns and grain banks; intensification of technology transfer and agricultural extension services; and support to organic farming will be given priority in the Second Green Revolution."
278,"Agricultural workers, many of whom are marginal farmers themselves, form a large section of the rural poor."
279,"The BJP is committed to lifting them above BPL levels, ensuring sustainable year-long employment with minimum wages, enhancing their labour productivity, expanding the social security net for them, and improving their overall quality of life."
280,"24 • Party Document Vol-1 The BJP is fully committed to preserving India’s animal wealth especially, to protection of Gau Mata (Cow) and her progeny."

286,5.8 Making India a Global Manufacturing Hub The BJP believes that India can become the manufacturing hub for the world.
287,"India’s capability to achieve this goal is evident from the highly encouraging initial successes in pharmaceuticals, automobiles, auto-components, engineering goods and some other products."
288,"We aim to provide the conditions for a broad manufacturing base that can export its products all over the world, and can compete not only on cost but also on quality and technology."
289,"In the process, we aim to actively facilitate the creation of global Indian brands and Indian MNCs."
290,"Our small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the KVIC sector, and traditional industries such as textiles, gems and jewellery and leather, have a huge potential to contribute to this endeavour."
291,This potential will be unleashed through suitable policy and institutional measures.
292,"We will take necessary steps to realize similar growth potential in our food- processing, telecom and IT hardware, and other industries."
293,A competitive manufacturing sector requires the simultaneous fulfillment of various conditions.
294,"They include a network of good roads and railways, efficient ports and airports, low-cost and reliable power, cutting-edge communication and IT infrastructure, strengthening of India’s core sector oil and natural gas, steel, coal, minerals, metals —, quality educational institutions that provide a   Election Manifestoes • 25 skilled workforce, a sophisticated financial sector which can meet low-cost capital needs of businesses, modern trading environment, and, above all, maximum government facilitation with minimum government interference."
295,"Specifically, firm and quick steps will be taken to put an end to the tyranny of the Red Tape and the Inspector Raj, which breeds corruption, drains the growth potential and demotivates Indian entrepreneurs."
296,We are proud that India has successfully embarked on this growth-oriented path.
297,"Unlike during the Congress years, the “Made in India” brand is making waves in global markets."
298,"We envision a future when it will dominate world markets in a wide range of products, creating large-scale prosperity and employment at home."
299,The BJP will actively work for the realization of this vision.
300,5.9 Putting India at the Centre of the Knowledge Economy The BJP is proud of the spectacular achievements of India’s software professionals and entrepreneurs both at home and abroad.
301,"They have not only given India a new stream of wealth-creation and employment generation, but also brightened our country’s image globally."
302,"The BJP believes that this is just the beginning, and the best of India in the emerging Knowledge Economy is yet to come."
303,"To achieve this, we have to consolidate India’s leadership in software exports and strengthen our IT hardware industry."
304,We also have to expand our share in employment-intensive IT-enabled services across the value spectrum through enterprises like call centers and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) centres.
305,"The BJP sees India emerging as a preferred service provider to the world in an ever-widening range of services, including high-paying professional services of teachers, doctors, lawyers, managers, accountants, and scientists."
306,"We will fully support our bio-technology sector, which is making rapid strides."
307,"India has acquired impressive self-reliant strengths in space research, peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and civilian applications of defence research."
308,These strengths will be further augmented and commercialised appropriately.
309,"We will also strive to develop Indian businesses in other frontier areas of technology, such as micro-electronics, nano-technology, new materials, etc."
310,"To achieve these ends, we have to make India a front-ranking   26 • Party Document Vol-1 nation in scientific and technological R&D."
311,"Partnership between Indian businesses and CSIR, DRDO, ICAR, ICMR, ISRO, BARC, IITs, universities and other government-supported research institutions will be vastly expanded."
312,We will actively encourage more foreign companies to set up their R&D centers in India or start joint R&D activities with Indian entities.
313,Our NRI and PIO professionals and entrepreneurs would be encouraged to participate in this partnership.
314,5.10 Our Vision for an Ideal Indian Village Majority of India’s population continues to live in villages.
315,"However, the neglect of the development needs of villages is one of the particularly damning parts of the legacy left behind by the long Congress misrule."
316,"This is clear from two stark facts: even after five decades of Independence, as many as 1.86 lakh villages one-third of all villages in the country were deprived of good roads; and as many as 60% of our rural households have no toilets."
317,"In line with what Mahatma Gandhi had said, the BJP believes that India cannot rise to her full potential without the revitalization of rural India."
318,"Our vision of an ideal Indian village is one that has the following attributes: (a) self-reliant society and dynamic economy that makes best use of local human and natural resources and has linkages to the national and global economy; (b) modern infrastructure and basic amenities—bijlee, sadak, paani, education, quality healthcare at the nearest place, and sanitation—that are needed to ensure a high quality of life for all inhabitants; (c) full employment to all able-bodied persons; (d) free of social and economic exploitation; (e) a harmonious, cooperative and caring environment; (f) Antyodaya or concern for the development of the last man; (g) effective functioning of Panchayat bodies with people’s participation and involvement of voluntary organisations; and (h) a vibrant cultural life that displays both modernity and pride in Indian traditions."
319,The BJP is committed to taking all our villages towards this ideal.
320,"We have taken several important steps in this direction, the most notable among them being the blueprint of a new comprehensive rural development initiative called PURA (Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas)."
321,"PURA aims at providing   Election Manifestoes • 27 four types of connectivity to every Indian village: Physical Connectivity, Digital Connectivity, Knowledge Connectivity, and Market Connectivity to every rural cluster in the country."
322,Speedy implementation of this programme will be our priority.
323,5.11 Our Vision for an Ideal Indian City India is rapidly urbanizing.
324,"At the same time, Indian cities and towns are groaning under unplanned and unaesthetic growth, made evident by their overstretched infrastructure, severe shortage of basic amenities, proliferation of slums, and unhygienic environment."
325,This has affected the quality of life of all sections of the urban population most of all the urban poor.
326,The continuance of this reality is incompatible with our vision of India as a Developed Nation.
327,No previous government paid as much attention to urban renewal as the Vajpayee Government has done since its inception.
328,"HUDCO’s loans for urban infrastructure rose by 550% during the past six years, compared to the previous 28 years."
329,"Our vision of an ideal Indian city is one in which our cities (a) provide a high quality of material and cultural life to all their inhabitants, with strong human bonds that is the hallmark of Indian society; (b) have good infrastructure, civic amenities, and pollution- free environment; (c) are free of slums and illegal encroachments, and display aesthetic city planning; (d) preserve their unique tangible and intangible heritage; (e) are engaged in promotion knowledge and diverse creative pursuits; (f) Have good municipal governance with strong community participation and, above all, (g) serve as engines of India’s rapid economic growth, providing adequate employment opportunities and ideal conditions for entrepreneurs and professionals to flourish in the era of globalisation."
330,The BJP is committed to working towards this ideal by introducing major urban governance reforms and massively expanding the programme for urban renewal in the coming years.
331,5.12 Dealing with the Challenge of Water The BJP recognises that scarcity of water in both rural and urban areas has assumed serious proportions in many parts of the country.
332,"There is an urgent need for a people’s movement, supplementing government efforts, for conservation, management and rational   28 • Party Document Vol-1 use of this scarce resource for drinking, agriculture, industry and domestic purposes."
333,The problem needs a multi-pronged strategy that combines both mega and micro initiatives.
334,"We remain fully committed to starting work on the interlinking of rivers, with due consideration for environmental protection and rehabilitation of displaced people."
335,"However, we attach greater importance to millions of local initiatives for desilting of tanks, lakes and reservoirs, restoration of wells, recharging of natural aquifers, building check dams, promotion of drip irrigation, desalination of sea water, rainwater harvesting, recycling of water, and other means of water conservation and efficient water management."
336,"Cleaning of all polluted rivers and traditional water bodies, with people’s participation of the kind that was evident in olden times, should be taken up in a mission mode."
337,5.13 Dealing with the Challenge of Employment The BJP recognizes that unemployment is a major problem faced by a significant section of the Indian youth.
338,"At the same time, we confidently state that no other government in the past paid as much attention to dealing with this problem, and achieved so much success, as did the NDA Government."
339,"It is our Government, which, for the first time, promised to facilitate creation of one crore additional employment and self-employment opportunities each year."
340,We have substantially succeeded in fulfilling this promise.
341,"Between 1999-2002, for which official figures are available, 84 lakh employment and self-employment opportunities were created on average, per year."
342,The nature of employment generation has altered with the changing nature of the economy.
343,Government jobs and jobs in the organized industry are shrinking not only in India and this is true of Congress and Communist-ruled States too but all over the world.
344,"At the same time, large-scale employment and self-employment opportunities have come up in services and the unorganized sector (whose preponderance in the Indian economy has been steadily growing), housing and road construction, telecom and IT, tourism, etc."
345,"In the coming years, our strategy to deal with the challenge of employment will be four-pronged:   Election Manifestoes • 29 5.13.1 Sustaining a high rate of annual GDP growth 8% going up to double digits and broadbasing the growth in employment- generating sectors of the economy."
346,"5.13.2 Higher allocation to, and better implementation of, the Government’s employment and self-employment generation schemes such as the Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana, which is the biggest food-for-work programme since Independence launched by our Government, self- help groups, etc."
347,5.13.3 Evaluating every development policy and programme from the point of view of its potential to create employment and self-employment opportunities.
348,Policies and programmes that promise to deliver this goal will be given special thrust.
349,"Thus, agri-processing, support services for agriculture, textiles, handicrafts, wasteland development, social forestry, housing and construction activities, renewal of urban infrastructure and amenities, retail trade, tourism, transportation, etc."
350,will be given priority in terms of investment and facilitation.
351,5.13.4 Providing special thrust to vocational education and training to match the needs of the economy.
352,In rural areas our focus will be mainly on skill upgradation of people engaged in traditional occupations.
353,"In urban areas our focus will be mainly on enhancing the employability of students and youth, and create an aptitude for self-employment and entrepreneurship."
354,5.14 Developing a Democracy of Stakeholders The BJP is committed to continuing reforms in the financial sector that have contributed to better performance of the corporate sector and the evolution of well regulated stock markets.
355,We believe that the gains of this process must be shared more equitably.
356,"Today, less than 2 per cent of Indians are retail investors."
357,We believe that the base of investment in equities must be broadened.
358,"The BJP believes that the advantages of low interest credit must be shared by all productive forces in society, including small businesses, the self-employed and farmers."
359,30 • Party Document Vol-1 The BJP is proud that the vigilance and intervention of the Union Government have helped revive institutions like the UTI.
360,We believe that public financial institutions and corporate houses must conduct themselves with exemplary responsibility.
361,5.15 Widening the Social Security Net The BJP is proud of the NDA Government’s initiative to launch a social security scheme for 37 crore people in the unorganized sector.
362,Expanding its coverage and its effective implementation will be our commitment.
363,The BJP believes that all Indians must have access to competitive and well regulated pension and insurance schemes tailored to every income level.
364,"The needs of senior citizens, widows, disabled persons, etc."
365,will continue to receive our special consideration.
366,We shall ensure that money invested will be both secure and will fetch good returns.
367,"   Election Manifestoes • 31 Focus on Social Development The BJP believes that faster economic growth cannot be an end in itself; rather, it is a means to ensure a high quality of life to all citizens by fulfilling their material needs and satisfy their social, educational and cultural aspirations."
368,6.1 Education for All We believe that both society and the Government at all levels must give top priority to meeting the goal of “Quality Education for All” since education aids both economic growth and social development.
369,Its importance in the emerging Knowledge Economy has increased manifold.
370,Enriched human resources of our one billion population can propel India into a higher orbit of development with limitless possibilities in the new century.
371,The BJP’s ideal of good education is one expressed in Swami Vivekananda’s profound words: “Education for Man-Making and Nation-Building”.
372,"India needs a system of education that opens the doors of knowledge to all citizens, develops their talents and skills, anchors them strongly in human values and Indian culture, reinforces their patriotism, and equips them to explore opportunities both in India and abroad."
373,"Because of inadequate and unbalanced attention by successive governments in the past, India continues to face major challenges in education."
374,"Our strategy for overcoming these challenges and unleashing the potential of India’s enviable human resources has the following underpinnings: 6.1.1 Steadily raising the total spending on education to 6% of the GDP by 2010, with enlarged public-private partnership."
375,6.1.2 Achieving complete eradication of illiteracy within a   32 • Party Document Vol-1 decade.
376,"For this, we will ensure that every child goes to school, every school is made accountable to the community, every State is made accountable for its quality education status, and appropriate resources both from Government and non-government sources are mobilized to match our ambitious goals."
377,"6.1.3 Further intensification of measures aimed at education of the girl child, and spread of education among SCs, STs, OBCs and minorities."
378,6.1.4 Improving the standards of education at all levels of the Educational Pyramid from primary to university.
379,6.1.5 Making quality education affordable to a common Indian family.
380,No student should be deprived of access to higher education for lack of resources.
381,"Hence, scholarships and soft loans should be made widely available."
382,"6.1.6 While encouraging private investment, necessary steps will have to be taken to check commercialization of education."
383,"6.1.7 Rectifying the biases in history education, increasing the moral and cultural content in syllabi, and restoring the neglected focus on character-building."
384,6.1.8 De-bureacratising the administration of our educational institutions; autonomy to centers of excellence; empowering teachers; and maximizing community participation.
385,"6.1.9 Enlarging the partnership between Government and the private sector, and between industry and universities, to promote world-class R&D."
386,6.1.10 Making India a preferred higher education destination for students from all over the world.
387,"This would not only reduce huge spending abroad by rich Indians, but also enable India to earn significantly from higher education."
388,6.2 Healthcare for All The BJP believes that healthcare is a basic need and rightful entitlement of every citizen.
389,"Hence, its provision should be made immune to the citizen’s economic status."
390,"Wrong policies, inadequate resource allocation, and neglect of our country’s traditional wisdom by the Congress governments have created daunting problems in this field."
391,"The BJP’s strategy to overcome them, and to enable India   Election Manifestoes • 33 to move quickly towards the goal of “Health For All”, is guided by the following principles: 6.2.1 The Centre and State Governments should together facilitate manifold increase in spending on healthcare, with enlarged public-private partnership."
392,"6.2.2 The priority of public spending should be on primary healthcare, with a focus on preventive rather than curative measures."
393,"6.2.3 Increasing people’s awareness about health issues and making them take good care of themselves by cultivating healthy habits and lifestyles; towards this end, building a strong physical and sports culture among all age-groups."
394,6.2.4 Healthcare should be made affordable to the poor and middle classes.
395,"6.2.5 The NDA Government’s good work in promoting yoga, ayurveda, naturopathy and other systems of indigenous medicine should be vastly intensified."
396,6.2.6 Private and foreign investment in tertiary and super- specialty healthcare should be encouraged.
397,"However, all private healthcare establishments should have enhanced obligation for treating poor patients."
398,6.2.7 Public-private partnerships should be institutionalized on the widest possible scale.
399,6.2.8 Concerted efforts should be made for India’s emergence as a centre of health tourism.
400,"6.3 Social and Economic Justice The BJP has always been a strong votary of social justice for SCs, STs, OBCs and other disadvantaged social groups."
401,"Going beyond the traditional advocacy of this important cause, we have also been consistently emphasising two related imperatives (a) social justice is incomplete without economic justice and political empowerment; and (b) The means to secure social justice (samajik nyay) have to also promote social harmony (samajik samarasata)."
402,"To advance these ideals, the BJP commits itself to: 6.3.1 Strict implementation of provisions of the policy on reservations."
403,"A major drive has to be launched for filling up all backlogs in jobs and promotions for SCs, STs and   34 • Party Document Vol-1 OBCs."
404,"6.3.2 Private sector enterprises will be incentivised for creating more educational, training, employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for SCs and STs."

410,6.3.8 Serious consideration to the recommendations of the newly established Commission for examining reservations for the poor among “Forward Classes”.
411,"6.4 Welfare of Tribals Of all the deprived and neglected sections of society, tribal Indians suffered the most during the long Congress rule."
412,Their ability to benefit from the policy of reservations in education and jobs has remained far less than that of the Scheduled Castes and OBCs.
413,Many of them have been uprooted from their habitations and livelihoods in forests.
414,Frequently they are victims of exploitation by powerful local interests and harassment by the police and government officials.
415,"They rank the lowest in literacy, longevity, health status and other indicators of human development."
416,The BJP is committed to ending the plight of India’s tribals.
417,"Ours was the first government, since Independence, to set up a separate ministry for tribal welfare and also a separate commission and a separate finance and development corporation for tribals."
418,We shall take necessary steps for regularization of land rights of tribals living on forest lands and for promoting their economic   Election Manifestoes • 35 activities based on forest produce.
419,"These measures, in addition to providing them livelihood security, will also help in preservation of our forests."
420,"The BJP believes that, as the original inhabitants of forests with a deep attachment to their natural endowments, tribals are the best protectors of our depleting forest and wildlife resources."
421,"We will also take steps to preserve tribal art and culture, honour tribal heroes, and frustrate efforts to create a wedge between tribals and non-tribals."
422,6.5 Women’s Empowerment The BJP is committed to gender equality and justice.
423,"We consider educational, social, economic and political empowerment of women to be one of the preconditions for making India a Developed Nation."
424,"Our Party is committed to providing women an enabling environment free from injustice and violence in the public as well as the private sphere, which would pave the way for women to contribute to every walk of life."
425,"We would develop strategies to enable women in balancing work and family by introducing a national childcare plan, decent wages, workplace flexibility, and greater career opportunities."
426,"The BJP believes that every able-bodied woman should have at least some source of livelihood, so that she can enjoy economic independence within the framework of a harmonious family."
427,"Education not only equips her to raise her economic and social status, but also helps our country realize many of its developmental goals."
428,"Accordingly, the BJP commits itself to eliminating gender disparities in both education and property rights."
429,"In official records of schemes such as giving land or a house, woman will be made a joint beneficiary having precedence over man."
430,"Opportunities for women in training, employment, self-employment and entrepreneurship will be expanded."
431,"Simultaneously, we will intensify governmental and societal efforts to ensure safety for women, and clamp down on female foeticide, dowry, trafficking and rape."
432,India has a very rich tradition of the social reforms movement where men championed the cause of women.
433,"In the 21st century, it is once again necessary for men to play a constructive role in establishing gender equality."
434,They can play an especially crucial role in ensuring dignity of women and eliminating violence against   36 • Party Document Vol-1 them.
435,Ours was the first party to raise the demand for 33% reservation for women in Parliament and State legislatures.
436,We remain committed to this goal.
437,It is well known that the NDA Government did its best to enact the Women’s Reservation Bill.
438,"However, the Congress and some other parties sabotaged it."
439,"The BJP is prepared to support any alternative proposal for women’s reservation, on which broad consensus can be forged."
440,We believe that the nation’s commitment to take this revolutionary step forward can no longer be kept in abeyance.
441,6.6 Population Control The BJP is convinced that neglect of the imperative of population control is one of the main causes for the shortcomings in India’s all-round development.
442,The Vajpayee Government has taken steps to overcome this neglect.
443,We believe that the goals and targets set in the National Population Policy can be realized only by making it a people’s movement.
444,State Governments—especially in those States that are lagging behind—and communities have to be energized.
445,The BJP also believes that the time has come to introduce a set of incentives and non-coercive disincentives for the success of this campaign.
446,We are in favour of providing incentives for the girl child within a two-child norm.
447,Our Party shall build consensus over ways that would ensure success of this mission.
448,6.7 Securing a Bright Future for India’s Children India is home to the largest child population in the world.
449,Every fifth child in the world is an Indian.
450,"Hence, what happens to India’s children will determine not only India’s future, but also the future of the world."
451,"For the BJP, securing a bright future for India’s children is both a moral obligation and a matter of political urgency."
452,"We are proud of the Vajpayee Government’s initiatives in this regard for example, making free and compulsory elementary education a fundamental right through a Constitutional amendment; launching ’Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’, the biggest ever educational programme since Independence; and vastly enlarging the scope of the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) to cover nearly all the blocks in the country."
453,"Election Manifestoes • 37 We are committed to further intensifying our efforts to put the needs, aspirations and rights of children at the heart of our development agenda."
454,"Drastic reduction in infant and maternal mortality, special focus on the education of the girl child, ending malnutrition among children from poor families, elimination of child labour, and the care of orphans will be our priority."
455,6.8 Unleashing India’s ‘Yuva Shakti’ Demographically India is a Young Nation.
456,Nearly 65 per cent of our population is below the age of This ‘yuva shakti’ (youth power) is a source of immense strength and hope for the India of our dreams in the 21st century.
457,"Our first priority is to ensure that every young Indian is gainfully employed or self-employed, securing not only their own livelihood but also contributing to their family’s well-being and to the country’s progress."
458,"By their very nature, young people are an overflowing reservoir of energy, enthusiasm, creativity, idealism and patriotism."
459,It is the duty of the government and society to create opportunities for the full flowering of these attributes.
460,Care should be taken to see that their grievances and resentment over any issue are not exploited by parochial and anti-social elements.
461,The spirit of adventure among the youth and their natural inclination for voluntary service need to be promoted.
462,"Infrastructure for sports, arts, cultural activities and social service, and support for youth organizations engaged in these activities, need to be stepped up at all levels from the national to the local."
463,"In particular, Indian sports, which have suffered marginalisation, deserve special encouragement."

467,38 • Party Document Vol-1 Good Governance Issues 7.1 Governance Reforms The principal aspect of the Congress misrule was its failure to transform India’s hard-won Swaraj (self-governance) into Su-raj (good governance).
468,"It caused the government to enter every sphere of our national life, excessively enlarging the ordinary citizen’s interface with the public authority."
469,"The overload of the government has led to inefficiency, harassment and corruption."
470,"Rather than being at the service of the people, the state machinery has reduced them to being supplicants."

474,Punitive levels of taxation created a national culture of dishonesty.
475,The licence-permit-quota raj produced a shortage economy and bred corruption and nepotism.

483,"7.2 Re-orienting the Priorities of Government The BJP believes that the thrust of the Union government in future should be on the core areas of national security, internal security, macro-economic management, and creation and upgrading of infrastructure."
484,"It should also expand the scope and improve the quality of services and amenities in the social sector, particularly targeted at the poor and disadvantaged communities."
485,The government’s traditional function of administration and upholding the rule of law and justice will have to be further strengthened.
486,"In the economic sphere, the government should progressively withdraw from involvement in non-priority sectors."
487,It should create more avenues for entrepreneurship in a well-regulated competitive framework.
488,"In general, it should reduce its role in manufacturing and services business, where the private sector can serve the people better except where it is required for strategic reasons, to prevent private sector monopolies, run important utilities, or in exceptional circumstances."
489,"At the same time, there is a need to enhance systemic capabilities for better policy formulation in the social sector, better designing of schemes and programmes, and, above all, better monitoring of their implementation."
490,"Towards this end, there is a need to maximize community participation and involve voluntary organizations, professional experts at all levels."

506,"The 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Constitution, introduced by the Congress government, devolved many important functions to Panchayati Raj Institutions."
507,"However, they failed to equip these institutions with necessary financial and administrative powers to discharge their Constitutional obligations."
508,"The BJP will remove this shortcoming by enacting, if necessary, a new Constitutional amendment."
509,The institution of the Gram Sabha will be strengthened.
510,"We believe that it is the most effective platform for promoting grassroots democracy, since it enables all the people in a village to discuss every developmental work, scrutinise the allocation and spending of funds, and evaluate the performance of panchayat and government functionaries."

527,"7.8 Empowering Civil Society After Independence, the Congress Party let the country down on good governance."

529,"As a result, the people’s initiative and their efforts to solve their own local problems took a back seat."
530,"The Government did not sufficiently trust the organizations of civil society, and the people in turn did not trust the Government to deliver."
531,The lack of people’s participation in government-led development became one of the principal reasons for India’s slow progress.

533,"The NGO sector, too, needs to apply self-correctives for it to play its role in the developmental process."

1647,May all enjoy good health.
1648,May all see auspiciousness.
1649,May none experience distress.
1650,May peace prevail everywhere!
1651,"THIS timeless motto of universal happiness and peace is the heritage of this ancient Indian civilization, which assumed the character of Bharatvarsha in Bharat Khand."
1652,"Here, a nation, which Megasthanes noted ‘never invaded others and was never invaded,’ existed long before the ideas of civilization evolved elsewhere."
1653,"This ageless nation is the embodiment of the eternal values enshrined in the concept of ‘Sanatana Dharma’ which, according to Maharishi Aurobindo, is synonymous with Indian nationalism."
1654,The idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam—world as a family—is integral to the concept of Sanatana Dharma.
1655,This gigantic idea is an exclusively Indian contribution to world peace.
1656,This ancient nation evolved a world-view based on the motto Loka samasta sukhina bhavantu (Let the entire world be happy) thousands of years before any League of Nations or United Nations was thought of to avoid global strife.
1657,The Indian nation evolved this grand vision not by marching its armies and conquering the rest and offering peace; but by the inner-directed pursuit of universal values by the Rishis living in the forests and mountains of India.
1658,"The well-being of all, in short, is the Indian mission."
1659,It is not   142 • Party Document Vol-1 limited to the residents of Bharat or the adherents of any particular faith or creed.
1660,"That is why Bharat received with open arms all faiths and people fleeing persecution—whether it was the Jews, Parsis, Muslims or Christians—and preserved and protected them long before any other civilization could think short of exterminating those who differed from the ruling faiths and people."
1661,"Israeli society has openly acknowledged that out of over a hundred nations in which Jews sought refuge, only in Bharat they were received and treated well."
1662,It is because religion in ancient India meant faith in general and not any particular faith.
1663,"It is this ancient Indian mind that formulated the Constitution of India, guaranteeing equal treatment to all faiths and their adherents and it is not the Constitution that shaped the Indian mind."
1664,Diversity is an inseparable part of India’s past and present national tradition.
1665,"The BJP not only respects but celebrates India’s regional, caste, credal, linguistic and ethnic diversity, which finds its true existence and expression only in our national unity."
1666,"This rich tradition comprises not only the Vedas and Upanishads, Jainagamas and Tripitaka, Puranas and Guru Granth Sahib, the Dohas of Kabir, the various social reform movements, saints and seers, warriors and writers, sculptors and artists, but also the Indian traditions of the Muslims, Christians and Parsis."
1667,"The Bharatiya Janata Party is a proud inheritor of this tradition while all other political parties have branded everything associated with this great tradition as sectarian, unworthy of being followed."
1668,"The post-Independence tendency to reject all ancient Indian wisdom in political life led to all pre-Independence values and symbols—be it the idea of spiritual nationalism expounded by Swami Vivekananda, or the concept of Ram Rajya articulated by Mahatma Gandhi, or the soul-stirring ‘Vande Mataram’ song composed by Bankim Chandra being discarded as unsecular and unacceptable."
1669,The BJP rejects this attitude and idea of disconnecting from the past.
1670,The past is inseverable from the present and the future.
1671,"That is why Swami Vivekananda said, ‘It is out of the past that the future is moulded."
1672,It is the past that becomes the future’.
1673,"BJP’s Vision: An Inheritance From India’s Freedom Movement THE BJP shares, embodies and energizes the vision of every patriotic Indian to see our beloved country emerge as a strong,   Election Manifestoes • 143 prosperous and confident nation, occupying her rightful place in the international community."
1674,"It is a vision to see our sacred Motherland freed from the scourge of bhookh (hunger), berozgari (unemployment), bhay (fear) and bhrashtachar (corruption)."
1675,"Lastly, it is a vision to see India, the world’s oldest cradle of civilization, transform itself yet again into a benign global power, contributing her material, intellectual, cultural and spiritual energies to change the paradigm at the global level to save the world from the gathering civilizational crisis."
1676,"As Arnold Toynbee said, ‘The Western beginning must have an Indian ending if the world is to be saved from destruction.’ It was this very same vision which inspired millions upon millions of freedom-loving Indians of all castes, communities and regions to give their all for the liberation of Mother India from the yoke of British colonial rule."
1677,"It was a vision which all the stalwarts of our freedom movement, belonging to different ideological and political backgrounds, said in their own separate yet complementary ways."
1678,"Mahatma Gandhi coined a uniquely Indian idiom—‘Ram Rajya’—for this common national vision, emphasizing, as a cautionary direction to future rulers of India that, ‘There can be no Ram Rajya in the present state of inequalities in which a few roll in riches and the masses do not get even enough to eat.’ The Context and the Issue in the 12th Lok Sabha Poll THE general elections to the 12th Lok Sabha is the inevitable result of the instability forced on the country by the Congress and the United Front."
1679,The two formed a negative and opportunist combination to thwart the mandate of the people in the 11th Lok Sabha poll and allowed the rejected Congress Party to do back- seat driving.
1680,"The negative combination was a symbol of instability from day one and was, for most part of its existence, in intensive care."
1681,"It collapsed, as it had to and demonstrated how the mischief played on the people of India after the 11th Lok Sabha poll recoiled on the mischief-makers themselves."
1682,This has made stability the principal issue in the coming election in a manner it has never been in our history.
1683,"Also, the election to the 12th Lok Sabha is not only a vote on the despicable record of malgovernance of the two United Front regimes spawned by the hung 11th Lok Sabha."
1684,"Rather, as the last   144 • Party Document Vol-1 parliamentary poll in this century and as one taking place in the Swarna Jayanti year of India’s Freedom, it is a vote on nearly five decades of misrule by the Congress and its clones."
1685,The BJP and its allies have entered the electoral fray with the supreme confidence of winning a clear mandate from the people of India to rule for the next five years.
1686,"This mandate will be a vote not only against the rank instability of the two United Front Governments, but also against the static, anti-people, anti- development ‘stability’ of the previous Congress Governments."
1687,"At the same time, it will be a positive vote for the BJP’s solemn pledge to provide a dynamic, pro-people, pro-development, anti- status quoist stability under the able Prime Ministership of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee."
1688,"Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee: Ability, Integrity and Universal Acceptability THE positive vote for the BJP is grounded in our philosophy, our policies, our programmatic commitments, the performance of our State Governments and, of course, the unimpeachable personal qualities of our top leadership."
1689,"In Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the people see a leader who combines ability with integrity, charisma with character and experience with universal acceptability."
1690,"He is not a person who claims leadership by birth in, or relationship with, any dynasty."
1691,He is a leader by virtue of his long and dedicated service of the nation and its people in and out of Parliament.
1692,"Under Shri Vajpayee’s leadership, the BJP and its allies, if elected to power, will marshal the requisite will to chart the way towards the fulfillment of the unfinished agenda of transition from Swaraj to Su-raj."
1693,This Election Manifesto outlines how the BJP will effect change with continuity.
1694,It asserts the principles and beliefs that will serve as the beacon and an internal watchdog for the BJP in governance.
1695,"The five-fold concept of Shuchita (probity in public life), Suraksha (security), Swadeshi (economic nationalism), Samajik Samarasata (social harmony) and Hindutva (cultural nationalism) will constitute the core content and ideological pillars of the BJP."
1696,"These principles will be manifest in our commitment to national security, good governance, national unity and integration, democracy, genuine secularism, eradication of mass poverty, opportunity for economic   Election Manifestoes • 145 advancement for all, social justice, gender justice, harmonious Centre-State relations, probity in public life, revival of institutions, politics of consensus and cooperation as against confrontation and, last but not the least, raising India’s prestige, profile and power in the international arena."
1697,These commitments will guide the BJP in its endeavor to provide a Stable Government under an Able Prime Minister.
1698,"   146 • Party Document Vol-1 Our National Identity Cultural Nationalism THE BJP is committed to the concept of ‘One Nation, One People and One Culture’."
1699,"The unique cultural and social diversity in India is woven into a larger civilizational fabric by thousands of years of common living and common and shared values, beliefs, customs, struggles, joy and sorrow, as well as symbols of high degree of unity without uniformity."
1700,Our nationalist vision is not merely bound by the geographical or political identity of Bharat but it is referred by our timeless cultural heritage.
1701,"This cultural heritage which is central to all regions, religions and languages, is a civilizational identity and constitutes the cultural nationalism of India which is the core of Hindutva."
1702,This we believe is the identity of our ancient nation ‘Bharatvarsha’.
1703,"Every effort to characterize Hindutva as a sectarian or exclusive idea has failed as the people of India have repeatedly rejected such a view and the Supreme Court, too, finally endorsed the true meaning and content of Hindutva as being consistent with the true meaning and definition of secularism."
1704,"In fact, Hindutva accepts as sacred all forms of belief and worship."
1705,The evolution of Hindutva in politics is the antidote to the creation of vote banks and appeasement of sectional interests.
1706,Hindutva means justice for all.
1707,The BJP is convinced that Hindutva has immense potentiality to re-energize this nation and strengthen and discipline it to undertake the arduous task of nation-building.
1708,This can and does trigger a higher level of patriotism that can transform the country to greater levels of efficiency and performance.
1709,"It is with such integrative ideas in mind, the BJP joined the Ram Janmabhoomi movement for the construction of Shri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya."
1710,This   Election Manifestoes • 147 greatest mass movement in post-Independence history reoriented the disoriented polity in India and strengthened the foundation of cultural nationalism.
1711,The BJP is committed to facilitate the construction of a magnificent Shri Ram Mandir at Ram Janmasthan in Ayodhya where a makeshift temple already exists.
1712,Shri Ram lies at the core of Indian consciousness.
1713,"The BJP will explore all consensual, legal and constitutional means to facilitate the construction of Shri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya."
1714,"   148 • Party Document Vol-1 Agenda for Institutional Rejuvenation Strengthening Democracy’s Pillars THE strength of a democracy is directly proportionate to the strength of the three pillars on which it rests—the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary."
1715,Five decades of misrule and misuse of these institutions has eroded their strength.
1716,Corruption at the highest levels of the Executive has corroded people’s faith in Government.
1717,"The Congress and UF Governments’ inability to take firm decisions and make tough choices, apart from their failure to confront disruptive forces, has weakened the authority of the Indian State."
1718,Over-centralization of power at the Centre and unbalanced models of development have led to Centre-State friction.
1719,Abuse of constitutional provisions like Article 356 and the misuse of Raj Bhavans as extension counters of the ruling party at the Centre have defiled the sanctity of the country’s Constitution.
1720,The BJP will earnestly set itself to the task of strengthening these institutions of the Republic through an agenda of reform and rejuvenation.
1721,The primary task is to restore to the State—and thus to Government—its honour and prestige.
1722,The BJP will thus restore to Government its moral authority to rule.
1723,"We propose to undertake the following agenda for rejuvenation: Constitutional Reforms The BJP will appoint a Commission to comprehensively review the Constitution of India, in the light of the experience of the past 50 years and make suitable recommendations."
1724,The Commission will comprise constitutional experts and eminent parliamentarians.
1725,The BJP is committed to take necessary steps to prevent   Election Manifestoes • 149 misuse of Article 356 of the Constitution.
1726,"The BJP will carve out Uttaranchal, Vananchal, Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh as separate States."
1727,Delhi will be given full Statehood.
1728,"The BJP will provide all three regions of Jammu and Kashmir—Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh—with regional development councils."
1729,The BJP will abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution.
1730,"Electoral Reforms THE BJP, which has been singularly championing the cause of electoral reforms since the days of the Jana Sangh, believes that one of the principal causes of corruption and corrosion of our polity is our faulty election process."
1731,"The BJP will, immediately on assuming office, introduce a comprehensive Electoral Reforms Bill, much of the groundwork for which has already been done but not acted upon."
1732,"To ensure free, fair and fearless elections and to prevent the use of money power and muscle power, the BJP will: Update and adopt the Goswami Committee Report; Consider introducing a scheme for State-funding of election expenses incurred by all recognized parties; Undertake immediate delimitation of Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies; Make it mandatory for parties to submit audited accounts for public scrutiny; Examine the feasibility of introducing the list system or a mixed system of elections; and; Undertake the process of issuing multi-purpose identity cards to all citizens and make it a mandatory requirement for voting."
1733,Judicial Reforms THE Judiciary is one of the watchdogs in a democracy and in recent times has played an important role in pursuing cases of corruption and abuse of public office.
1734,But the Judiciary faces problems that need to be addressed and solved in consultation with the Chief Justice of India.
1735,"For speedy, fair and inexpensive justice, the BJP will:   150 • Party Document Vol-1 Fill vacancies in high courts and the Supreme Court without any delay; Appoint special judges to clear the huge arrears at all levels of the judiciary; Legislate to the effect that cases are heard on a day-to-day basis and not held up by inordinate adjournments; Expand and strengthen the existing legal aid facilities for weaker sections of society; and, Set up a National Judicial Commission which will recommend judicial appointments in the High Courts and the Supreme Court and draw up a code of ethics for judges."
1736,"Reforms in the Law and Order Machinery THE security of each citizen is of utmost concern for the BJP, which is committed to a riot-free and terrorism-free India."
1737,"Whether on the streets or at home, every Indian must feel safe and protected from violence in any form."
1738,The BJP will squarely and purposefully address the deteriorating law and order scenario in various parts of the country.
1739,The BJP will: Forthrightly meet all challenges to the State and its citizens by terrorists and extremists.
1740,"Our approach will be firm but always fair; Enact a suitable law to tackle terrorism while ensuring that there are no loopholes for its misuse; Provide timely assistance to State Governments to maintain law and order by supplementing local police forces with adequate central forces; Equip police with modern arms and communication facilities; Seek immediate reports from State Governments on incidents of police firing and monitor follow-up action, especially in fixing of responsibility if the firing was unprovoked or uncalled for; Hold district officers squarely accountable for mismanagement of public order and take prompt action in light of findings of time-bound inquiries; Ensure that complaints by citizens do not go unattended; Improve the intelligence-gathering mechanism at all levels   Election Manifestoes • 151 to tackle mischief-makers before they can act and keep State Governments posted about all intelligence gathered on a day-to-day basis; Launch a nationwide drive to identify the influx of illicit arms and their possession."
1741,Proliferation of small arms directly affects law and order and the nation’s security; Crack down on narcotics smuggling which is linked to narco-terrorism and drug-usage.
1742,"Existing law in this regard will be made more effective and implemented; Rationalize the number, structure, composition and role of paramilitary and special forces like the National Security, the Special Protection Group and the Rapid Action Force; and, Review VIP security arrangements so that they are neither exaggerated nor intrusive."
1743,We will ensure that VIP security arrangements do not affect the collective convenience of the citizens.
1744,"Administrative Reforms THE BJP believes that despite reduction in the traditional regulatory role of the bureaucracy, it will remain vital to the provision of a just and progressive administration; efficient delivery of services to the people; and, implementation of socio-economic development programmes."
1745,We will strive to re-inculcate in the public service the spirit of service to the common people.
1746,Public servants at all levels will be given due support and trust.
1747,"In turn, they will be held fully accountable for efficiency, probity and integrity."
1748,"To usher in a responsive and responsible administration, the BJP will: Ensure objectivity and fairness in recruitment, promotions and transfers."
1749,"Introduce suitable minimum tenures for officers manning such posts as secretaries to the Government, chief secretaries, DGPs and district officers; Deny extension to officers after superannuation or upon completing their fixed tenures; Give protection to public servants in the discharge of their duties and disallow interference from extraneous quarters; Undertake reforms in district administration, police and other organizations interfacing with the people, with   152 • Party Document Vol-1 emphasis on responsiveness and accountability; Avoid proliferation of bureaucracy by meeting new requirements, to the extent possible, through redeployment and training of existing staff; Give wide publicity to rights of citizens and the services and facilities to which they are entitled; Provide speedy redressal of individual and community grievances; Withdraw Government from areas of unnecessary intervention; Enhance skills and efficiency of public servants through special training programmes; Infuse talent through lateral entry of personnel; Ensure speedy resolution of anomalies in implementing the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission and strengthen arrangements for employees’ welfare and housing; Raise the retirement age of Government employees from 58 to 60 as per the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission; and, Increase skills and efficiency of public servants by training programmes; infusion of talent will also be secured by lateral entry of people from the private sector, NGOs and educational and research institutions."
1750,"Restructuring of Centre-State Relations THE present iniquitous Centre-State relations not only tend to erode the autonomy of the States and jeopardize their rightful and legitimate role in our federal polity, but also impinge on their financial capabilities and operational flexibility."
1751,"To make Centre- State relations more harmonious and in keeping with the spirit of a federal polity, the BJP will: Immediately implement the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission; Consult State Governments before appointing Governors and consider ways and means of preventing misuse of Raj Bhavans for political purposes; Increase allocation of resources to the States in real terms."
1752,"This, coupled with greater functional autonomy, can go a   Election Manifestoes • 153 long way in making States stable, strong and prosperous."
1753,"To achieve this end, we will: (a) Increase the States’ share of gross proceeds of Central Tax revenues to 33 per cent; (b) Give adequate assistance to the States to lessen the burden imposed by the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission; (c) Allow States the freedom to raise funds by issuing tax-free bonds; (d) Transfer external assistance to States on the same terms and conditions on which it is received from external donors; (e) Treat loans against small savings as loans in perpetuity; (f) Increase Plan assistance to States in real terms; Swiftly clear infrastructure projects in power, water and mineral sector."
1754,The Central Electricity Authority and Central Water Commission will function as consultancy organizations and not have any regulatory role in project clearance.
1755,The present policy of environmental clearance will be reviewed.
1756,"Panchayati Raj FOR better local self-governance at the village level, the BJP will: Introduce suitable changes in the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution with a view to further strengthening Panchayati Raj institutions and giving them greater autonomy; Endeavor to make the Panchayati Raj institutions financially self-reliant."
1757,Systemic Cure for Corruption THE BJP believes that morality and ethics together form the underpinning of good governance.
1758,"In the past 50 years, the Congress has systematically dismantled all norms of honesty and integrity in Government, indulging in corruption at all levels and resisting all attempts to bring the guilty to book."
1759,"The UF had declared its intention to expose the corrupt, but ended up protecting them from the arms of justice."
1760,The BJP will seek to undo this grievous wrong committed against the nation by the Congress and later by   154 • Party Document Vol-1 the UF and set an example of unimpeachable accountability and impeccable probity in public life.
1761,"For a clean public life, the BJP will: Make it obligatory for every elected representative to make public within 90 days his income and assets, as well as those of his/her spouse and dependent children and parents."
1762,"These declarations will be open to public scrutiny and have to be made every year; Appoint a Lok Pal to inquire into allegations of corruption against anybody holding public office, including the Prime Minister; Introduce extensive regulations to ensure that conflict of interest does not influence decisions taken by those holding public office; Modify and reform the methodology of Government approval of contracts, schemes and large value agreements to make them more transparent; The powers of patronage, the discretion to say ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to simple daily requirements of the citizens will be done away with; Expeditiously deal with unresolved cases of corruption and in which no action has been taken in the last 12 years; and, Give greater autonomy to the CBI, in keeping with the recent Supreme Court order, so as to prevent investigating agencies from being used to subserve the political designs of the ruling party."
1763,Right to Information THE BJP believes in taking concrete steps to promote transparency in the functioning of Government as a confidence- building measure.
1764,The working of a Government should not only be transparent but should be perceived to be so.
1765,"We, therefore, subscribe to the principle of sharing information about the Government’s work."
1766,"The BJP will: Enhance public access to information to the maximum extent feasible; Review laws and regulations concerning confidentiality; and, Introduce social audit of development programmes,   especially in rural areas."
1767,Election Manifestoes • 155    156 • Party Document Vol-1 Our Swadeshi Approach Making India a Global Economic Power THE economic policy-making in the last five decades has been shaped more by dogma than by a rational debate on what suits the country’s interests best.
1768,"In 1950, Congress discarded the Gandhian approach and adopted the socialist pattern without any debate."
1769,"Now, after the collapse of the socialist paradigm, our entire establishment has defected to the type of free-market system that prevails in the Western countries, once again without any debate as to whether such a system can be wholly transplanted to India."
1770,"The policies of liberalization, particularly globalization, pursued by the Congress and later by the UF Government have resulted in economic stagnation."
1771,What this nation needs now is a practical approach that is devoid of dogma and is guided wholly by considerations of national interest and what is appropriate for us.
1772,"Fifty Years of Wasted Opportunities IN fact, the five decades of Congress and quasi-Congress rule have been a virtually wasted opportunity."
1773,In these fifty years the absolute numbers of people living below the poverty line almost doubled; the Indian economy grew at a mere 3.5 per cent while most of Asia raced ahead towards prosperity.
1774,"At the same time, Indian industry, services and agriculture were largely rendered internationally non-competitive and disadvantaged."
1775,"During most of this period the BJP and its forerunner, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, had been urging a liberal economic regime in which the full creative genius of the Indian people could flower."
1776,We opposed the license-permit Raj.
1777,We opposed the command economy.
1778,We opposed senseless central planning.
1779,We opposed the inefficient State   Election Manifestoes • 157 capitalism that was promoted at the cost of our entrepreneurial class.
1780,"We opposed the crony capitalism that came about as a result of the collusion between the politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen."
1781,We opposed the nationalization of vast areas of the economy.
1782,We opposed the corruption that inevitably became a part of the system that was created.
1783,We continuously opposed the Congress party that was both the creator and then the creature of this corrupt system.
1784,"Phony Liberalization: A More Impoverished Economy AFTER four-and-a-half grossly wasted decades, the Congress Government of the day woke up to the bankrupt reality, but, under the guise of correcting the past wrongs, actually surrendered to IMF conditionalities."
1785,With a gun at its head it began to do what it does best—double talk.
1786,It said it was liberalizing the economy and actually gave itself more opportunities for corruption.
1787,This phony liberalization turned out to be a period of record loot under which foreign companies flourished and the Indian ones floundered.
1788,"Within the first year, as the Finance Minister crowed that the surge in the share market was a sign of confidence in his policies, the bubble burst to uncover a scam of record proportions."
1789,Foreign companies were allowed to increase their equity at par instead of paying the market price for additional shares.
1790,"Over 2,100 companies were allowed to raise over ₹ 35,800 crore from the market, mostly at unreasonable premia."
1791,The markets have since come down to abysmal levels; as a result millions were financially devastated.
1792,"More than 600 of these companies, which cumulatively raised over ₹ 10,000 crore, have simply disappeared, walking off with the money."
1793,The Congress Party has no answer for this.
1794,Many in the Cabinet were directly involved in the scams.
1795,"The then Prime Minister’s office, too, was not exempt from this taint."
1796,"The last six years, when the much-touted reform has been under way, have been years of extreme difficulty for the common man."
1797,"The wholesale price index of food grains has gone up by over 70 per cent, which is an effective inflation rate of over 20 per cent."
1798,"Instead of creating prosperity for all, this so-called liberalization further impoverished the majority with a result that, according to the NCAER, 59 per cent of all households now have a monthly income of less than ₹ 1,000 or about ₹ 200 per person which is much less than the poverty level monthly per capita income of ₹   158 • Party Document Vol-1 263!"
1799,"By contrast, only 4.1 per cent of all families have an income of over ₹ 40,000 per year."
1800,"A study by Oxfam, while somewhat more charitable as far as the overall figures are concerned, categorically states that rural poverty during the Manmohan Singh years grew from 35.5 per cent to 48.6 per cent."
1801,"After this period of so-called liberalization and growth, so much hyped by the Congress and later by the quasi-Congress UF Governments, we have become a more impoverished society than before."
1802,"According to the World Development Report, the highest 20 per cent of Indians accounted for 41.3 per cent of the national income, while the bottom 20 per cent accounted for a mere 8.8 per cent!"
1803,"The hollowness of the economic policies of the past fifty years and, in particular, of the past seven years stands totally exposed by the glaring inequity and the high incidence of poverty."
1804,From 1981-82 to 1990-91 industrial production grew at an average of 7.8 per cent a year.
1805,After five years of so-called liberalization it grew at an average of 5.7 per cent.
1806,"During the period 1990-96, in a reversal of the previous decade’s performance, the compound growth rate of foodgrain production was 1.7 per cent while the population grew at 1.9 per cent."
1807,"Consequently, the per capita availability of cereals, which was 511 grams in 1991, has come down to 464 grams now."
1808,It is small wonder that prices of cereals alone have gone up by almost 20 per cent in 1996 while those of vegetables have risen by a huge 63.3 per cent.
1809,"The prices of wheat and onions have spiraled while those of luxury cars, mobile phones and color TVs have come down."
1810,This is indicative of the warped sense of economic and social justice that has been prevailing in our country in the past few years.
1811,"Instead of waking up to the deteriorating foodgrain scenario, successive Governments have been neglecting agriculture."
1812,"In 1996-97, the proposed outlay for agriculture was ₹ 1,969 crore or ₹ 349 crore over the previous year’s revised estimate."
1813,This did not even cover the official inflation and the impact of the Pay Commission’s recommendations.
1814,"The Swadeshi Approach: Reforming the Reforms Process IN 1991, the BJP cautioned the Government to embark upon internal liberalization first and defer globalization."
1815,We advocated the reinstatement of the Swadeshi idea particularly because of the heavily one-sided pro-West WTO in the offing.
1816,"However, in a   Election Manifestoes • 159 matter of five years, the BJP stand on Swadeshi has been vindicated."
1817,Swadeshi simply means ‘India First’.
1818,This is the governing principle of all nations.
1819,"Now the idea of Swadeshi is being accepted in most quarters, also by the Indian industry."
1820,"Nevertheless, the economy of India has come under tremendous pressure because of misguided tariff reductions and an uneven playing field for the Indian industry."
1821,"The BJP is fully aware that, when it comes to power, it will be inheriting a badly managed economy and a badly directed reform process."
1822,The broad agenda of the BJP will be guided by Swadeshi or economic nationalism.
1823,The fundamental approach of the BJP is that it is imperative to develop a collective national will and confidence that ‘India shall be built by Indians’.
1824,National development will largely depend upon national effort and national capital and savings.
1825,"Even after the so-called reforms, the share of FDI in national investment is less than 2 per cent, that is, out of the total national investment of over ₹ 12,30,000 crore, FDI amounted to only ₹ 18,500 crore during the years 1991 to 1996."
1826,"It is clear that foreign capital will be only of little value to the national economy, though crucial to some sectors like infrastructure."
1827,"Every nation advocates free trade in all global fora, but, in practice, they compulsively resort to quotas, tariffs and anti-dumping measures to protect their national interests."
1828,"Whether it is the USA which resorts to Super 301, anti-dumping and high tariff, or it is Japan whose market is very difficult to access even now, the story is the same."
1829,"While the declared agenda is free trade, the undeclared, but actual, agenda is economic nationalism."
1830,"India, too, must follow its own national agenda."
1831,This spirit is Swadeshi.
1832,Role of Government in a Liberalized Regime THERE is a great misconception about the role of the Government in a liberalized regime.
1833,There is an impression that the Government retreats leaving the hidden hand of the market to manage the economy.
1834,"Governments all over continue to actively manage and protect their economies, national industry and employment."
1835,"The paradox is that, the greater the liberalization, the more demanding is the involvement of the Government to protect national industry and employment."
1836,160 • Party Document Vol-1 Full Liberalization and Calibrated Globalization THE Government and Indian industry need to evolve a consensus on the time span required to enable our industries to adjust to the exacting demands of international competition.
1837,"It means rapid, large-scale internal liberalization, but calibrated globalization so that the Indian industry gets a period of seven to ten years for substantial integration with the global economy."
1838,"On the basis of this consensus, the Government and the industry should work out a strategy to create an atmosphere of international acceptability and manage external relations, particularly with the WTO."
1839,"India must move carefully and gradually towards integration with the global economy and even as it so does, it must act in a manner that suits its national interest."
1840,This strategy recognizes that Indian industry needs a period of transition before it can compete with global players.
1841,"All policies of tariff reduction and lifting of quantitative restrictions will be formulated taking the above facts into accounts, but the objective will be to protect the national economy and national interest like all nations do and not to indulge in economic isolationism."
1842,Study and Appraise the Impact of Reforms on the Economy THE process of liberalization and economic reforms needs to be properly strategized from the standpoint of broader national interest and rationally phased in.
1843,"In doing so, the experience of the Asian nations presently under pressure will also have to be taken into account."
1844,"As we approach the 21st century, we need to institute studies and appraise and review the reforms process and also the proposed reforms and redefine the broad contours of the national strategy for the next ten years."
1845,"Based on the appraisal, the BJP Government will clearly define the contours and schedule of the liberalization and reforms."
1846,"The procedural reforms like rectification of corporate law, tax law and other commercial laws will be separated from policy formulation like the policy on insurance and pension funds."
1847,"Our Medium-Term Agenda THE broad national agenda of the BJP, containing an illustrative list of important and priority items for preparing the nation for future challenges, is set out below:   Election Manifestoes • 161 India must adopt policies that will enable a sustained 8 to 9 per cent annual rate of growth of GDP."
1848,This would mean an agricultural growth of at least 5 per cent a year and industrial growth of at least 12 per cent a year.
1849,"Without powering agriculture in a big way, Indian growth rate cannot be sustained at higher levels."
1850,"China, endowed with much less cultivable land and resources, could achieve an average agricultural growth of 8 to 10 per cent a year between 1983 to 1993 and doubled its agricultural production."
1851,India can and should achieve this and more.
1852,The agricultural agenda should be designed accordingly.
1853,"A separate agenda for the non-corporate sector, which accounts for 40 per cent of the GDP, should also be pursued to achieve this target of sustained high growth."
1854,"Recognizing the gross neglect of proper strategy in the past, our Government will focus on a judicious combination of infrastructure and agriculture to achieve a high trajectory of growth."
1855,"In the next five years, we must become a credible partner in Asia’s development process and forge a relationship on equal terms with the major economic powers of the world—USA, EU and Japan."
1856,"In the next three years, our Government will strive to achieve strong macro-economic fundamentals; fiscal rectitude where, more than fiscal deficit, the revenue deficit is controlled; strong and viable balance of payments; monetary policy designed to resist unrealistic fall in rupee value; moderate inflation; and credit availability to industry."
1857,Some Important and Priority Items for the National Agenda The Government will formulate a system of voluntary compliance with all direct and indirect tax obligations with test-check assessments of select cases and expedite conviction of the defaulters.
1858,The Government will ensure a day-to-day working relationship with Indian industry through a structured forum like the MITI in Japan.
1859,"Even as the private sector will be encouraged to invest   162 • Party Document Vol-1 in infrastructure, the Government will also invest in infrastructure."
1860,The private sector has not been a major contributor in this area.
1861,"Even in the developed world, the share of the private sector in such development does not exceed 30 to 40 per cent."
1862,"For this purpose, the Government will: • Access the long-term debt market in Insurance and Pension Funds."
1863,• Set up national-level regulatory bodies for different areas of infrastructure.
1864,"• Bring about more transparency, institute contracts which are easily enforceable and formulate laws that simplify the procedures."
1865,"It will also: • Cut non-productive expenditure; • Disinvest in non-strategic PSUs; • Control and rationalize subsidies and trim all except those that benefit the weaker sections; • Reduce the size of the Government; and, • Simplify tax laws and widen the tax net."
1866,The Government will institute an effective anti-dumping machinery to prevent dumping from abroad and to prevent unfair anti-dumping action against the country.
1867,"The Government will ensure that a climate of competition is created in the insurance sector—if need be, by involving Indian private sector in the insurance business."
1868,"The Government will rationalize the banking sector by creating specialization in unit banking, retail banking and commercial banking."
1869,This will be done by consolidation and mergers to create global-size banks and promote efficiency and profitability to strengthen the Indian banking system.
1870,Resource Generation: Fiscal Policy and the Promotion of Savings All the above tasks will need large-scale resource mobilization.
1871,This will not only call for the widening of the tax base but also supplementing it with non-tax revenues.
1872,The BJP Government shall innovate such resource augmentation through motivated savings.
1873,The fiscal policy will aim to prevent the generation of black money.
1874,Tax on services will be reviewed.
1875,Election Manifestoes • 163 We will structure a fiscal policy that will help generate a higher level of savings.
1876,We will aim to increase the savings rate to 30 per cent in the next five years.
1877,"Acceleration of savings will require the elimination of dissavings, which, in its wake, will prune the size of Government and the public sector and generate the much-needed resources for attending to the highly neglected areas of social infrastructure like education and public health."
1878,"Like physical infrastructure, social infrastructure will be a priority on the agenda of the BJP Government."
1879,"In their abortive zeal for containing the fiscal deficit, previous Governments have cut plan expenditure drastically and, instead, increased revenue expenditure in unpruned regulatory arms of Government which have outlived their utility in the era of liberalization."
1880,This trend will be reversed and it is expected that the reactivation of public expenditure will pull the economy out of demand stagnation and recession.
1881,"It should be recognized that the halt in public investment in infrastructure, both physical and social, in the fond hope that did not materialize, of the private sector making good the gap, has caused undue harm to the economy."
1882,Eradication of Poverty Through Generation of Jobs THE above strategy is also firmly rooted in the recognition that growth cannot be sustained in the backdrop of accentuation in poverty and human misery.
1883,Poverty cannot also be wished away through an abstract definition built on calorific value.
1884,"A meaningful estimation of poverty will now be structured on the matrix of factors that dilute the quality of life such as illiteracy, lack of sustained employment, malnutrition, lack of shelter, safe drinking water, sanitation and health care."
1885,"The lot of the poor, thus defined, will be improved through a multi-pronged approach, with the focus on increased employment opportunities."
1886,The BJP Government will make the Ninth Plan itself an employment-focused Plan.
1887,"The development strategy followed in the last fifty years separates development from employment, treating human beings as fodder in the process of development."
1888,Employment has only received lip service in the economic plans; in effect it has received a very low priority.
1889,Employment has been treated as a by-product and not the main goal of development.
1890,It has been more so since 1991 under the half-baked reform philosophy.
1891,The   164 • Party Document Vol-1 all-West model of the reforms generates only jobless growth.
1892,"The BJP believes that it is only through full employment—not just any kind of employment, but gainful and productive employment— that rapid and sustainable development is possible."
1893,"It is through employment that the real purpose of development, namely, the raising of the living standards and dignity of the people, can be realized."
1894,"It is distressing to note that unemployment and underemployment and, consequently, poverty-prevails in our country on such a massive scale."
1895,"Even when the GDP growth rates have increased, employment growth rates have declined in agriculture as well as in industry."
1896,The prevailing employment growth rate is less than half of the rate at which addition to the labour force takes place.
1897,"The BJP will review the Ninth Plan in all its aspects, with the objective of installing employment as its centrepiece."
1898,"In the next ten years, over 10 crore people will be provided jobs, besides ameliorating the extensive underemployment and concealed unemployment."
1899,"Our strategy will consist of the following: A substantially higher growth rate of GDP of 8 to 9 per cent; Emphasis on sectors which offer large potential for employment, including small-scale, artisan-based and rural industries, infrastructure, housing (urban and rural), construction, agriculture, wasteland development and forestry and labour-intensive production; Opting for projects and technologies, wherever choices exist, without reducing productivity, that offer larger employment; Increasing productivity in the informal sector through the support of technology, credit and marketing; Redesigning the special employment programmes— Integrated Rural Development Programme, Jawahar Rozgar Yojana, Nehru Rozgar Yojana, Scheme for self-employment of the Educated Youth, etc.—to increase their coverage and effectiveness; Encouraging the employment of women; Fully involving the private sector and non-governmental organizations; Adopting the institutional approach of cooperatives,   Election Manifestoes • 165 wherever possible; Implementing the special employment programmes through panchayat institutions; and, Vocational training."
1900,"Our Commitment: Removal of Hunger and Ensuring Food for All IN this fiftieth year of Indian independence, we commit ourselves to freeing India of the scourge of hunger."
1901,"The Indian social traditions abhor hunger and had instituted different social, religious and cultural mechanisms to eliminate hunger."
1902,The tradition which acted as a social security against hunger weakened with the advent of colonialism and it never revived after we attained freedom.
1903,The result is that hunger has become part of Indian social life.
1904,"We have to and we shall, ensure that in this land, no one is obliged to sleep on a hungry stomach."
1905,"For this purpose, we shall explore and encourage all possible ways, both Governmental and societal, of ensuring food for all."
1906,"As a concomitant of food for all, we shall recast the agricultural policy of the country to increase food production so that India once again becomes the land of abundance in food in next five years."
1907,"Public Sector Reforms CUTTING down of dissavings will be possible only by pruning the public sector and confining it to sensitive areas where the nation’s physical or economic security is involved and to residual areas where the presence of public sector is necessary for providing a moderating or counterpoising role to the ill effects, if any, of an unchecked private sector."
1908,"The minimal public sector will be managed professionally, with least interference by Government."
1909,"While pruning the public sector, it will be ensured that the interests of workers are duly taken care of."
1910,Greater emphasis will be placed on retraining and redeployment aspects of the National Renewal Fund rather than confining its scope to retrenchment.
1911,Role of Foreign Direct Investment It is needless to add that national development will be largely funded by capital generated within the country and foreign investment will play only a small role.
1912,"The percentage of FDI to   166 • Party Document Vol-1 total investment in India during the years 1991-96 is less than 2 per cent and confirms that even in the post-reform period, national development has been almost entirely financed by local capital."
1913,"However, in areas like infrastructure (particularly energy, roads and ports), promotion of exports and high-technology industries, FDI can usefully supplement national efforts."
1914,Policies will be framed consistent with national interest in respect of FDI.
1915,The BJP Government will ensure that FDI flows into such priority areas and not in areas where the domestic industry is functioning well.
1916,The BJP Government will frame policies to restrict FDI in non-priority areas.
1917,FDI will be encouraged to promote exports rather than target the domestic market.
1918,FDI is welcome in a non-predatory role in joint ventures rather than in 100 per cent subsidiaries.
1919,"Generally, the role of foreign capital should be in harmony with and advance, the nation’s economic objectives, as also in line with other Asian countries."
1920,"Again, until the Indian economy reaches a level of global strength, takeovers of existing Indian companies by foreign companies will not be encouraged and suitable, transparent rules will be framed to give effect to this policy."
1921,"Even developed nations like France, Germany and Switzerland have restrictions on the takeover of domestic companies."
1922,National Agenda for Bhagidari Sector (Un-incorporated Sector) An analysis of India’s GDP shows that agricultural accounts for 27 per cent; corporate sector 12 per cent; and the Government sector 21 per cent; all adding up to 60 per cent.
1923,The balance 40 per cent of the GDP comes from the largest segment of our economy—the unincorporated sector (partnership/proprietorship firms) which bore the brunt of the license-permit quota raj at the cutting edge of its interaction with the organs of State power.
1924,Millions of un- incorporated enterprises in the country contributing 40 per cent of our national income did not deserve even a small paragraph in our Economic Surveys and Reserve Bank reports.
1925,This most important segment has so far commanded the least attention and virtually no legitimacy.
1926,"The entire establishment ignored these unincorporated enterprises which have a share of nearly 50 per cent of national income in the manufacturing sector, a share of 60 per cent in the construction sector, a share of more than 75 per cent in the transport sector, nearly 90 per cent in the trade sector, more than 80 per cent in hotels and restaurants and   Election Manifestoes • 167 nearly 100 per cent in the business and other services like that of a doctor, lawyer, accountant, goldsmith, plumber, porter, mechanic, electrician, tailor, barber, carpenter, driver, priest, cook, musician and in the crafts and professions."
1927,We neglected this sector (which is clubbed as part of households in our savings statistics) which constitute the largest segment of savers contributing around 60 per cent of our national savings.
1928,"During 1990-96 out of the total gross domestic savings of ₹ 11,32,029 crore, the savings by household sector was ₹ 8,94,918 crore, i.e."
1929,nearly 80 per cent and the Bhagidari sector is the largest segment of the household sector other than the salary earners.
1930,Any agenda for reform necessarily has to focus its attention on the largest segment of our economy which was also the least cared for during the inspector-raj nurtured by the socialistic regime.
1931,But the so-called reforms of the nineties did not address the serious issues of using the phenomenal and enormous savings rate of our middle-class.
1932,"The focus of the Government in the nineties, in the name of reforms, concentrated essentially on the corporate sector and foreign investment that came a cropper."
1933,"A clear understanding and a broad national agenda, with the following measures, are needed for the Bhagidari sector."
1934,(a) The financing cost for this sector is phenomenal and they borrow at usurious interest rates.
1935,"There is no exclusive, national-level financing agency for trade activities or for construction activities."
1936,Indian private-sector banks need to be encouraged and developed in these areas and the Government policies should facilitate the same.
1937,A separate development bank for this sector will also be considered.
1938,(b) There is no social security net for this sector.
1939,"With changing patterns in the joint family system, there is even more necessity to introduce the same."
1940,The Indian private sector insurance companies can provide this.
1941,"Unless and until the social security net is developed for this sector (of course, from the contributions of this sector), economic reforms will be a castle built on American sands and the European air, but not on Indian soil."
1942,"(c) In order to mobilize savings of this sectors for targeted   168 • Party Document Vol-1 poverty alleviation programmes, it would be desirable that full deduction is given for the traditional commitments of the sector, including family obligation and contribution of this sector for temples, mosque, gurudwaras, etc."
1943,where free food is provided to poor people daily.
1944,"This would reduce the leakages in the anti-poverty schemes currently undertaken, since this method would directly deal with the target groups."
1945,Local citizens committee can monitor this.
1946,The fear of God is a more powerful authority than that of the Government in a country like India.
1947,"(d) This sector is a target for all levels of the State machinery like politicians, policemen, tax officials and municipal authorities."
1948,A national-level awareness programme of this sector’s contribution and a national-level law to guard them against State excesses should also be formulated.
1949,This sector has the greatest potentiality to grow with a quantum jump if this agenda is implemented.
1950,Any attempt to increase employment and to eradicate unemployment must begin here.
1951,This sector at once provides self-employment and multiplies employment.
1952,"This single sector has the greatest potentiality to attack unemployment, poverty and hunger."
1953,"Role of Non-Banking Finance Companies THE BJP realizes that savings, banking and finance is in the Indian blood."
1954,"There are tens of thousands of private finance institutions – nidhis, chits and other native methods of augmenting finance and also modern-day non-banking finance institutions."
1955,The BJP views this sector as a potentially important one.
1956,"The policy on NBFCs has been ad-hoc and they have been dealt with, at times, in a reckless manner."
1957,"The new RBI guidelines preventing NBFCs from accepting deposits without rating is absurd, as we have not even developed standards for rating under Indian conditions."
1958,The BJP will review the entire regulation on the NBFCs and bring about an orderly growth and not planned destruction of this important segment.
1959,"This sector alone finances most of the transportation business and the non-corporate sector, which is the most important and the largest sector of the national economy."
1960,Election Manifestoes • 169 Industrial Policy Reform THE immediate task of the new Government will have to be to create conditions for industry to regain its lost momentum.
1961,Persistence of the present conditions will cause irreparable damage to the fabric of Indian industry.
1962,The BJP recognizes the need for corrective action on a war footing.
1963,We attach particular importance to the interdependence of industry and agriculture.
1964,We will improve inter-sectoral terms of trade and other linkages so that benefits accrue to both.
1965,"The BJP also reiterates the importance of the small- scale and cottage industry sectors, in view of their contribution to employment, wider participation and new entrepreneurship."
1966,"These sectors, which have suffered neglect by the Congress and the United Front Governments, will be given all encouragement and support by the BJP."
1967,The permit-quota raj created conflicts between large and small industries.
1968,"The BJP will strive to make small-scale units and large units, particularly where the former is the supplier of the latter, into a structured ally like in Japan and Korea."
1969,The BJP will formulate policies for large units to invest up to 25 per cent in the capital of the small unit so that the small unit has the backing of the large unit for purposes of availing bank loans or other credit.
1970,"By such a relationship, hundreds of small units can coalesce with a large-scale unit and benefit in a variety of ways."
1971,"In order to achieve the above objective, the BJP will: Further simplify industrial approvals and remove the plethora of restrictive controls that now exist."
1972,The Industrial Development and Regulation Act will be replaced by an Industrial Development Act.
1973,"The role of the Government will change from the restrictive, as it has been so far, to one of extending support and encouragement; Encourage research and development in enterprises as well as in specialized institutions; Permit hazardous industries only in specified areas."
1974,Separate satellite industrial parks will be set up exclusively for such units; Give all encouragement and support to the small-scale and cottage industry sectors.
1975,"Agencies will be established to give them help in getting scarce raw materials, technology upgradation and marketing of their products."
1976,Flow of credit   170 • Party Document Vol-1 to these sectors will be enhanced.
1977,We will reconsider the Abid Hussain Committee recommendations on SSI units in the light of the difficulties and apprehensions of SSI.
1978,The investment limit of ₹ 3 crore will also be reviewed if any misuse of the higher limit is found.
1979,"The tiny sector will be relieved of labour laws and other legislations by which they are subject to harassment; and, Ensure a healthy capital market with the twin objectives of increasing capital investment in the corporate sector and of providing protection to the investing public."
1980,"Making Labour a Proud Partner in the Nation’s Progress OUR plan to reform the reform process through the Swadeshi approach, includes: A strong commitment to make labour, both organized and unorganized, an equal and proud partner in the nation’s progress; Rationalize and simplify labour laws."
1981,Recognize trade unions on the basis of secret ballot.
1982,Introduce worker-participation from the shopfloor to the boardroom.
1983,"Strengthen institutional mechanisms to ensure speedy, just and corruption-free redressal of labour grievances."
1984,Policy on Tourism THE BJP recognizes the importance of tourism as a generator of jobs and foreign exchange.
1985,Its Government will: Promote tourism as a way to have a more meaningful and wider understanding of India and its people.
1986,"Evolve a national policy for tourism to provide needed infrastructure such as hotels, transports and removal of bureaucratic impediments."
1987,Create a regulatory mechanism to avoid long-term damage to the heritage and the environment.
1988,"Take care of the pilgrimage component of tourism by ensuring the cleanliness, basic facilities, etc."
1989,at pilgrimage centres of all sects.
1990,Shift the exclusive emphasis from five-star tourism to tourism for the masses.
1991,"Election Manifestoes • 171 Enable India to have its rightful share in the growing global tourism industry, while ensuring that Indian culture, heritage and values are preserved and projected."
1992,"Policy on Infrastructure SINCE infrastructure constitutes a critical aspect of the national economy, an overview of the BJP’s thinking on infrastructure is presented under: Policy on Energy and Power INVESTMENT in power must be accelerated urgently."
1993,Any further delay in adding new capacity will inflict considerable costs on the economy.
1994,"In power generation, most of the private sector investments have got bogged down in never-ending negotiations."
1995,The Government will ensure that all eight ‘fast track’ projects start construction in 1998.
1996,Transmission and distribution need to be strengthened.
1997,"After appropriate study, a National and/or Regional Power Trading Corporation may be set up for efficient use of the generated power."
1998,Power Grid Corporation’s plans to implement a national grid will be speeded up.
1999,"To ensure that private investors in this sub-sector do not have the same experience as their counterparts in generation, the Government will create a standardized application procedure with clear and transparent rules for their entry; The Government will strive for a national consensus to ensure that, in five years, a commercially viable power tariff structure comes into operation; BHEL will be revitalized to expand its capacity to emerge as a global player in the next five years; The Government will review the liquid fuel policy and institute a more efficient and fair policy regime; To encourage non-conventional sources of energy, the Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources and IREDA will be strengthened."
2000,"Large-scale research and development will be instituted to develop more non-conventional energy; Other things being equal, preference will be given to Indian companies in power generation and distribution;   172 • Party Document Vol-1 The long-stalled nuclear power programme will be restarted."
2001,India has mastered the technology and the entire nuclear fuel cycle.
2002,There is no reason why only two nuclear plants have gone critical in the last seven years.
2003,"Instead of importing nuclear power technology from Russia, there is no reason why our trained engineers should not be exporting Indian nuclear power technology to foreign countries; In the oil sector, the Government will involve the Indian private sector in oil extraction and refining on the explored oil fields and will, on viable terms, allow Indian joint ventures with foreign companies in oil exploration and extraction; and, In the coal sector, the Government will increase the production of coal, reduce costs and raise productivity."
2004,It will involve the Indian private sector in coal mining so as to meet the increased energy needs of the country.
2005,Railways TRANSPORT must become multi-modal to meet the needs of development.
2006,The most important type of transport is the Indian Railways.
2007,The rate of growth of the Railways has come down.
2008,A complete review of the working of the Indian Railways would have to be undertaken along with a study of the use of roads in the areas served by the Railways.
2009,"There are thousands of kilometers of rail track lying unused, while the roads alongside those very tracks are overburdened with traffic, despite Railways being cheaper."
2010,"Private participation in using such idle railway tracks will be allowed; An efficiency audit of the Railways will have to be done to prevent wastage and disuse of stores and rolling stock; Also, a study should be done to ensure that trains carry payloads up to 4,000 tonnes; We will institute research and development for the Indian Railways suited to Indian conditions."
2011,"; Container transport will be encouraged on a point-to-point basis; and, The Railways will also run pilgrimage specials connecting the several places of pilgrimage in the country both from a commercial point of view and service to the pilgrims,   as well as from the standpoint of national integration."
2012,Election Manifestoes • 173 Roads and Bridges INADEQUATE road networks have led to higher transportation costs that have also eroded the international competitiveness of the Indian economy.
2013,"Trucks in India travel only 200-250 kilometers a day, compared to 500-600 kilometers a day in developed countries."
2014,"Therefore, proper road construction will lead to a big increase in transport efficiency."
2015,"For this purpose, the BJP will do the following things: The National Highways Authority of India will be made the regulator for this sector."
2016,"It will be responsible for setting tolls, inviting bids from private companies, evaluating them and awarding them."
2017,The BJP will continue with the current fiscal incentives for this sector.
2018,"Like in other sectors, it will identify the non-fiscal barriers to investment in this sector, for their speedy removal; The Government will identify the four most heavily used stretches of the national highway system."
2019,It will formulate and implement an action plan to upgrade them within two years using both the public and private sectors wherever necessary.
2020,"It is important that these critical bottlenecks be removed as soon as possible; For all other highways, the Government will invite the private sector to upgrade them, for which they will collect toll revenues."
2021,"If the private sector is not interested, the Government will create a State-owned National Highway Development Corporation that will go ahead and upgrade these highways, for which it will also levy tolls; A proportion of the taxes on motor vehicles and on petrol and diesel collected in each city will be handed over to that city or town to use to upgrade the roads in those cities; and, Except for very long distance and high investment projects, the policy will be to involve only the Indian private sector in the bids."
2022,174 • Party Document Vol-1 Inland Waterways THERE is an enormous potential for inland waterways in India.
2023,"The estimated length of waterways available is over 30,000 kilometers and they touch almost all the important centres in our country."
2024,The cost of water transport is a third of the cost of surface transport.
2025,Waterways were once considered to be better for India than other forms of transport in many areas.
2026,"The development of waterways will also lead to the proper maintenance of reservoirs and canals, since revenue would be generated from water transport."
2027,The BJP will develop a blueprint for water transport and allow private parties to get into inland water transport.
2028,Sea Ports MOST Indian ports are operating at more than 100 per cent capacity.
2029,Yet they are very inefficient when compared to other parts in the region.
2030,"As part of a proper ports development programme, the BJP will do the following things: Convert ports into companies that can raise funds from the debt and equity markets."
2031,"The initial shareholding of this company can be divided four ways with the central Government, the State Government, the city administration and the general public; Ports will be encouraged to invest in the latest information technology and cargo handling equipment to reduce turnaround time; The workers of ports should be retrained to use these new technologies."
2032,"Ports must be more efficient, but they need to become so without displacing too many workers; Develop Mumbai and Vishakhapatnam ports as megaports, which will be warehouses for the country on either seaboard; Private sector minor ports should be encouraged."
2033,"They will take the load of the bigger ports; and Except for large international ports, in other cases, preference will be given to Indian companies."
2034,Coastal Shipping INDIA has a long coastline and its peninsular formation is ideally suited for development of coastal shipping.
2035,"Considering   Election Manifestoes • 175 that coastal shipping is cheaper than surface transport and further considering that nearly 30 per cent of the cargo carried by Indian Railways is coal, coastal shipping can relieve the surface transport sector of a big burden."
2036,Indian private sector will be involved in coastal shipping development.
2037,Cheaper movement of coal by coastal shipping will also enable thermal power generation along the coastline to transmit power inland.
2038,"Telecommunications The aim of our telecom policy will be to: Increase the number of phone lines dramatically, especially in villages; and, Satisfy the more demanding audio, video and data communications needs of business and homes."
2039,"For these purposes, the BJP Government will take the following steps: The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 will be replaced with new legislation that takes into account the advances in the last century and more and reflects the current and future status of the telecom sector; The Government’s role will be that of a regulator, so the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India will be strengthened; The department of telecom will be converted into a company called India Telecom."
2040,"To expedite the shift from a Government department to a profit-making company, the Government will divest a portion of its shareholdings in India Telecom at the appropriate time; The Government will not discriminate between Government- owned companies or the new private companies coming into operation."
2041,"All restrictions (inter-circle, long-distance, international) will be removed on schedule, or earlier, in the interests of greater competition; However, the Government will maximize the returns from the companies that it already owns (India Telecom, VSNL, MTNL, ITI)."
2042,"To make these telecom companies competitive, they need to have the freedom to hire the best people and pay them market salaries."
2043,"These companies will be given this freedom; Since India is expected to have the sixth-largest number   176 • Party Document Vol-1 of phones in the world in the next few years, it must have a telecom-manufacturing industry to match this."
2044,"The Government will encourage the creation of world-class telecom-manufacturing in India, that is encouraged to use indigenously developed technology; and, The Government policy for foreign direct investment will discourage foreign majority holdings in telecommunication companies."
2045,"The BJP’s Approach to the WTO The major task facing our country in the economic sphere is the preservation of a measure of autonomy in the management of the national economy, which the Congress Government surrendered meekly by accepting without resistance the highly prejudicial WTO conditionalities."
2046,"The Government should have the sovereign and inalienable right to choose its economic system as well as its legal, social, cultural and political system in accordance with its historic traditions, national genius and the express will of its people."
2047,This would be the foremost objective of our party to restore the desired autonomy.
2048,"Agriculture, which concerns the bulk of our people and, in particular, WTO issues connected with subsidies, fertilizers and seeds so that the interests of the farmer and consumer of food are not sacrificed would be adequately examined."
2049,No legislations concerning agriculture and commitments under the Uruguay Round would be allowed to be implemented without full democratic discussion.
2050,"The small-scale sector, which is the backbone of our economy and employment would not be exposed to unequal competition, both from large houses in the country and from the transnational corporations from abroad."
2051,The small-scale sector would be strengthened.
2052,"The agreement on services, particularly financial services, would be monitored in respect of the entry of powerful foreign interests in our country."
2053,The immigration laws abroad should also not confuse rights of the developed countries for effective opportunities for our people in those countries.
2054,"Election Manifestoes • 177 The patent system, in particular, would not be allowed to become an import monopoly and working of a patent and dissemination of technology would be ensured by an effective and strong ‘license of right’ and ‘compulsory license’ regime."
2055,"The BJP would strive to work out a strategy and consensus within the nation and with all nations similarly placed to lobby for legitimately justified modification of the perspective, programmes, rules and schedule of the WTO."
2056,"   178 • Party Document Vol-1 Social Infrastructure A Better Standard of Living is Every Indian’s Birthright DESPITE various programmes launched at various points of time and although food production has touched 195 million tonnes from a low of 50 million tonnes in 1951, India still loses 11 per cent of under five children and 3 to 4 per cent women in the reproductive age group due to malnutrition."
2057,It is a reflection of the performance of previous Governments that 53 per cent of the country’s children aged under five are malnourished.
2058,India has an abysmal record of 28 per cent low birth weight babies.
2059,Fifty per cent of the population suffers from iron deficiency and 20 per cent of all maternal deaths are due to anemia.
2060,"To wipe out these shameful figures, the BJP will: Ensure household food security commensurate with the national food security so that all families in rural and urban areas get two square meals a day by the year 2003; Review and vigorously implement the National Nutrition Policy and the Plan of Action on Nutrition so that all goals are achieved by their target dates; Revamp and expand the scope of Integrated Child Development Services; and, Use the PDS effectively to help the poorest of the poor."
2061,Housing for All: A New Habitat Policy THE BJP recognizes that soon one-third of India’s population will be living in urban centres.
2062,It is important to ensure planned development of these centres from small towns to the big cities and the large metropolises.
2063,Urban slums are rapidly developing and conditions in them deteriorating.
2064,"Particularly important are the problems of drinking water, sewage and waste disposal in   Election Manifestoes • 179 urban centres."
2065,There is a severe shortage of housing both in the urban and rural areas.
2066,"For us, shelter is a basic human need that must be met at all cost."
2067,Extensive housing schemes also generate employment.
2068,"Therefore, the BJP will: Evolve a National Housing and Habitat Policy in consultation with State Governments and Urban Development Authorities."
2069,The policy will aim at providing shelter to all by year 2010 and also facilitate the construction of 20 lakh new houses each year; Review the provisions of the Urban Land Ceiling Act and ensure that land and property prices do not escalate as they have in the past; Promote affordable mass housing for low and middle- income groups; Make available adequate credit to house-seekers on attractive terms; Take steps to make additional rented accommodation available; and Launch special concessional schemes to provide rural poor with adequate and affordable housing.
2070,"Health for All OUR goal will be ‘Health for All’ by 2003, but the poor and disadvantaged will be a special responsibility."
2071,"Health delivery is most effective when decentralized to State, district and local levels, with communities taking leadership and responsibility for health and development."
2072,"In this context, our ancient and local wisdom is of greatest importance."
2073,Public health cannot be regarded as only a consumer of resource.

2248,Successive weak and irresolute Governments have imperiled national security.

2266,These must be neutralized.
2267,"We are, therefore, committed to: Establish a National Security Council to constantly analyze security, political and economic threats and render continuous advice to the Government."

2290,The BJP will give socio-economic problems of this region high priority as lack of development has helped anti-national and separatist elements in their attempt to foment disaffection.
2291,We believe development is one of the effective antidotes against such attempts.
2292,The distance between this region and Delhi has further heightened their sense of alienation.
2293,Nothing has been done in the past 50 years to bridge this physical and emotional distance.

2298,Illegal Infiltration THE Congress and United Front Governments for their own narrow and selfish reasons have been deliberately negligent of this problem.
2299,The total number of illegal infiltrators from Bangladesh is officially ascertained at over 1.7 crore.
2300,The adverse impact of this on our economy and social and political order poses problems of grave magnitude.
2301,This cannot be allowed to continue.
2302,Our Government will:   Election Manifestoes • 201 Take more stringent measures to intercept illegal infiltrators and turn them back.
2303,Fencing of the border wherever possible will be urgently taken up.
2304,"Border patrolling will be intensified; Initiate steps to detect illegal infiltrators and delete their names from electoral rolls; and, Maintain a national register of citizens."

2307,   202 • Party Document Vol-1 Our Social Philosophy Rooted in Integral Humanism THE Bharatiya Janata Party’s social agenda flows from its ideology of Integral Humanism.
2308,"Our ideology rules out contradictions between society and its very components, as also between society and the individual."
2309,"Our concern for the last man in the last row is as deep as that for the first man in the first row, if not more."
2310,"The BJP’s concept of social justice, therefore, does not seek to create rifts and schisms between various sections of society, but aims at removing social and economic disparities that have resulted in denial of a share in power, impoverishment and erosion of human dignity."
2311,"An ideal society is not one that is compartmentalized in segments, but is an integral whole, harmonious and conflict-free."
2312,"Hence, we subscribe to Samajik Samarasata (social harmony) and Samajik Nyaya (social justice) and strive to avoid social strife."
2313,"Equal Rights for all in Satta (power), Sampatti (prosperity) and Samman (dignity) The BJP will actively promote a casteless socio-economic order that will effectively provide access to equal opportunity for all citizens, irrespective of their caste, creed, religion and gender."

2318,"A befitting National Memorial in honour of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, who dedicated his life to the cause of social justice, will be erected at Chaityabhoomi in Mumbai on the lines of national memorials like Raj Ghat, Shanti Van and Vijay Ghat."
2319,Our Commitment to the Welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes NEARLY four-and-a-half decades of Congress rule and the recent UF regime have failed to empower the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.
2320,"While thousands of crores have been spent, ostensibly for their welfare, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes face increasing impoverishment and marginalization."
2321,Eighty per cent of members belonging to these sections of Indian society have been pushed below the poverty line.
2322,"The BJP is committed to the social, economic and political empowerment of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, so that the wrongs of the past are corrected in a time-bound manner for a better future."
2323,"To fulfill our commitment, we will be guided by a policy whose highlights are as follows: Existing institutions and Constitutional safeguards for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes will be strengthened and made operationally more effective."
2324,"The provision of special facilities and preferential opportunities, including reservations, will be implemented in a manner so as to benefit the broadest cross-section and largest number of SCs and STs."
2325,The reservations policy will be backed up with a statute and all backlogs will be cleared within a specified time- frame.
2326,Special tribunals will be set up under CAT to expeditiously deal with complaints of non-implementation of the reservations policy and related grievances.

2339,This is integral to our concept of Social Harmony (Samajik Samarasata).
2340,We reject the divisive and casteist politics of our adversaries that have neither economically empowered the bulk of the OBCs nor reduced their educational backwardness.
2341,"We propose to: Continue with the current reservations policy for the Other Backward Classes till they are socially and educationally integrated with the rest of society; Provide training, financial support and management facilities for upgradation of skills in traditional industries and professions of OBCs; Take corrective and remedial measures in view of recent   206 • Party Document Vol-1 macro-economic policy decisions that have rendered several sections of people belonging to the OBCs jobless; and, Make the National Backward Classes Finance Development Corporation fully operational."
2342,"Our Commitment to Minorities: Towards Equal Opportunity and Prosperity THE BJP’s concept of Positive Secularism is: Justice for All, Appeasement of None."
2343,"In the name of ‘secularism’, the Congress and the United Front parties have shamelessly pandered to communalism and indulged in ‘vote-bank politics’."
2344,"As a result, members of the minority communities have been reduced to nothing more than numbers to be played with at the time of elections."
2345,"While these parties have gained, the minorities have lost—as also has India."
2346,"The minorities have been cynically used for the purpose of garnering votes these past 50 years, but their socio-economic problems have remained unattended."
2347,"The true meaning of ‘secularism’, equal respect for all faith—sarva panth samadar—has been perverted by the pseudo-secularists into appeasement of regressive elements."
2348,The coming election provides a window of opportunity to the minorities to take a fresh look at the options that are available to them.
2349,They should not go blindly with the so-called ‘secular’ parties that have done nothing to solve their real socio-economic problems.
2350,"Instead, they should make a clean break with the past and support the BJP."
2351,"The patron-client relationship advocated by others is different from what we offer—equal rights, equal opportunities, equal privileges and equal responsibilities."
2352,"Above all, we have proved in the States where the BJP is in power that we can maintain communal peace and harmony; we can ensure security of life and property; and, we can protect the honour and dignity of the minority communities."

2355,Our Commitment to Kashmiri Pandits SEPARATIST and sectarian militancy in Jammu and Kashmir during the late ’80s and right up to the mid ’90s resulted in mass migration from the Valley and other areas in Kashmir.
2356,"More than 300,000 people, including 250,000 Kashmiri Pandits and Pandits, and Punjabi and Dogra Hindus, apart from Muslims, were forced to flee their home and hearth in the Valley by terrorists and fundamentalists."
2357,The BJP promises immediate action to help those displaced from the Kashmir Valley and other parts of the State.
2358,"Towards this end, we propose to: Work with the Jammu and Kashmir Government to evolve a feasible scheme for the phased return of the displaced people, especially the Pandits, to their ancient land; Provide all assistance to the Jammu and Kashmir Government in order to ensure that the displaced people receive adequate financial assistance, health care, housing,   208 • Party Document Vol-1 education and employment facilities till such time they are able to return to their land; Evolve a rehabilitation package, including adequate assistance to rebuild houses that have been destroyed, that will be an incentive for returning to the Valley; and, Ensure that their security is in no way imperiled after they have returned to the land from which they were forced out against their will."
2359,"Our Commitment to Human Rights THE BJP believes that upholding human dignity, ensuring justice for all and protecting citizens from the tyranny of the State are integral to India’s ancient traditions and together form the cornerstone of civil society."
2360,A just State is one that is kind but also firm in dealing with those who seek to undermine the foundations of a civil society.

2363,Non-Resident Indians THE BJP believes that Mother India has a special responsibility towards her children abroad.
2364,"We will depart from the current policy of disinterest and disregard for Non-Resident Indians and actively pursue a policy that will nourish the umbilical link between all people of Indian origin, wherever they may be, with their motherland."

2366,"In this context, it would be instructive to study the role of Jews and Chinese in the USA in mobilizing opinion favorable to their countries; Encourage Indians living abroad to project their national identity even while retaining their respective regional and linguistic identities; Introduce fresh incentives for Non-Resident Indians to invest in their motherland, like China has done with the Chinese people living abroad; Play an active role in ensuring job and social security for Non-Resident Indians working in the Gulf and South- East Asian countries with special emphasis on preventing exploitation and providing legal assistance; and, Revitalize the ties between Mother India and people of Indian origin living in countries like Guyana, West Indies, Fiji, Mauritius and South Africa."
2367,   210 • Party Document Vol-1 Nari Shakti Empowerment of Women THE BJP believes that true human development cannot take place without the empowerment of women.
2368,It is not enough to talk about removing discrimination against women and establishing gender equality.
2369,"We need to create new mechanisms for the social, political and economic advancement of women as also to generate social awareness on gender issues."
2370,"One such mechanism is empowerment, including empowerment through enactment of laws."
2371,Yet another mechanism is capacity-building through education and skill acquisition.
2372,The BJP pledges itself to legal and policy level initiatives to remove discrimination against women and to ensure that their rights and dignity are not trampled upon.

2379,"Expected to hit the one billion mark by the year 2001, India’s population is set to overtake that of China unless the growth rate is checked and then reversed."
2380,The danger of a runaway population growth is there for all to see: A rapidly expanding population means a slower rate at which development can be effected.
2381,"While India was one of the first countries in the world to recognize the need to control the growth of its population in order to ensure a better distribution of the fruits of development, successive Union Governments have failed in the implementation of this important programme."
2382,Excesses during the Emergency have given way to complacence and dangerous negligence.
2383,"The BJP will put population-related issues, including family planning, firmly back on the national agenda."
2384,"The BJP believes that the country’s runaway population growth can be arrested and rolled back through increased awareness, facilitating access to family planning measures, persuasive Government policies and rapid development."
2385,It is an universally acknowledged fact that ‘development is the best contraceptive.’ But we realize that Government alone cannot fulfill this gigantic task.
2386,The Government’s efforts must be supplemented by a vigorous people’s movement.
2387,"In addition, the BJP proposes to: Formulate a National Population Policy by acting on the reports of the National Development Council and the Swaminathan Committee."
2388,"This Policy will seek to bring the population growth close to stabilization by the year 2010; Provide incentives to those who opt for the ‘two-child’   214 • Party Document Vol-1 norm and high incentives to those who embrace the ‘single- child’ norm; Take all measures for reducing infant mortality rates and improving child health; Promote women’s education, employment and empowerment since these can be effective means of population control as they will allow women a decisive role in regard to their reproductive health and family planning; Introduce disincentives which will apply to all sections of society in order to discourage large, unsustainable families; Ensure universal access to family planning information and quality contraceptive facilities by involving non- government organizations and promote awareness among the people, especially women, through counseling, educational programmes and widest use of modern multimedia capabilities; Introduce family planning methods and facilities that will allow women greater freedom of choice without imperiling their health as well as support research relating to these methods; Encourage women to seek reproductive health services as well as launch a special campaign to educate local communities about negative practices; Offer a special incentive in the form of a fixed deposit that will mature in 21 years for those couples who have only a girl child or those who adopt a girl child under a ‘Dattak Putri Yojana‘; Make family planning an integral part of our development policies to ensure widest applicability of these incentives and disincentives and provide motivation for a small family norm; and, Ensure that the legal age of marriage is strictly implemented."
2389,"   Election Manifestoes • 215 Our Policy for India’s Youth Yuva Shakti for Rashtra Shakti OUR youth are the strength of the family, village, locality and the community."
2390,They are also the biceps or triceps of the nation.
2391,"They are the most idealistic, inspired and energetic section of our nation."
2392,"But in the absence of a driving national vision and a credible national leadership, their energy has remained dormant or got misdirected."

2394,"The BJP recognizes their immense creative potential to effect positive social, cultural and political changes."

2400,"It is a national shame that India, the second most populous country in the world, almost never finds a place in the medals tally in the Olympic Games."

2413,"   Election Manifestoes • 217 Family and Society Preserving Integrity of the Family IN the Indian view of life, an individual is not an independent or sovereign being, but an integral member of the family, community, the nation and the human race."
2414,"The basic institution that anchors the individual in society and the nation, as also links him to the past and the future, is the family."
2415,The BJP believes that the integrity of the family institution is the main guarantor of India’s civilizational continuity.
2416,"Hence, the importance of protection and nurturing of family values cannot be overstated in the context of nation-building."
2417,"If the family is the brick, society is the edifice."
2418,"Our Charter for Children: No Child Shall Go To Sleep Hungry THE BJP believes that children are born—and have the right—to be happy; they have the right to food, shelter and clothes; they have the right to education."

2420,India has a high infant mortality rate.
2421,Many children suffer from malnutrition and hunger.
2422,The majority of them have no access to education.
2423,"Deprived of their childhood, millions of children have to work to feed themselves and contribute to the family income."
2424,Constitutional provisions and legal safeguards have been followed more in the breach than in practice.
2425,There are more children working in factories and fields than in schools; there are more children living in deprivation than in secure homes.
2426,"The BJP, in keeping with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, will ensure that the ‘best interests’ of India’s children are taken into account in all situations."
2427,"Children’s rights are the foundation on which better societies can be built and, therefore, we will implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child in both letter and spirit."

2430,We will amend the present Child labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act to remove the distinction between hazardous and non-hazardous processes.

2434,We will devise a suitable scheme with full community participation to keep this solemn promise.
2435,Caring for our Disabled AS many as fifty million Indians are denied the chance to participate in the nation-building process because of their physical and other disabilities.
2436,"Rather than recognize the contributory potential of these differently abled men   Election Manifestoes • 219 and women, they are socially, economically and politically marginalized."
2437,"Successive Congress Governments, as well as the UF regime which made cynical use of the slogan of ‘social justice’, have done nothing to empower the disabled."

2442,Caring for our Senior Citizens INDIAN family and social traditions have always held elders in high esteem.
2443,"A person who attains the status of an ‘elder’ and a ‘senior citizen’ is looked upon as a repository of experience, values and wisdom, which need to be transmitted to the younger generation."
2444,"Sadly, the alien nature of socio-economic development in India in the past fifty years has brought the institution of family under great pressure."
2445,One of the worst victims of this process are our senior citizens.
2446,"Our Government, in line with the BJP’s philosophy, will take all possible measures to alleviate the difficulties and hardships suffered by our senior citizens."
2447,220 • Party Document Vol-1 We will also support and encourage all societal efforts to restore the traditional respect and regard for the elders.

2471,   Election Manifestoes • 227 Our Policy on Information Technology Making India a Software Superpower RECENT advances in Information Technology (IT) have enshrined IT as the most revolutionary tool ever created in known human history.
2472,IT promises to transform every facet of human life and usher in a knowledge-based society in the next century.
2473,It has already been delivering on some of these promises.
2474,"The world of computers, telecommunication, television, the Internet and all other media is converging very rapidly, shrinking, in the process, Planet Earth into a Global Village."
2475,"This has opened up infinite and previously unimaginable new possibilities in work, education, communication, commerce, manufacturing, agriculture, services, health-care, leisure and entertainment."
2476,"It will influence the working of our political and democratic institutions, too."
2477,"Although India lagged behind in the earlier phases of the Industrial Revolution due to historical reasons, she has served notice of soon emerging as a major global IT power."
2478,Indian computer scientists and professionals—both those serving in India and abroad — have shown with their achievements that they have the potential to make our country a front-runner in the age of Information Revolution.
2479,The BJP attaches a high priority for accelerating this process.
2480,"Specifically, we will do the following: Unveil a National Informatics Policy with a strategic 10- year perspective to fully harness the benefits of IT in every sphere of our national life; Create awareness that IT is not a luxury, but the very backbone of future development; The biggest contribution computers and the Internet can make is in the field of education."
2481,Our IT policy shall strive to take India towards the goal of universal computer literacy and Internet access in the shortest possible period;   228 • Party Document Vol-1 Make India a software superpower by giving all-out encouragement to software companies to grab a large share of the global market.
2482,"Our aim is to have software exports increase by ten times in the next five years; The BJP will endeavour to provide, by the year 2000, computers and facilities for computer education in all secondary schools in the country, including those in rural and remote areas, which otherwise have basic facilities like a proper building and power; Formulate a bouquet of policy initiatives to support, within a competitive environment, Indian IT companies and professionals to rapidly expand the scale of their operations and to enable them to take the Indian IT flag all across the globe; Provide broad-band nationwide communication links using satellites, optical fiber-cables and wireless."
2483,"No region will be without this essential IT infrastructure; Ensure the fast nationwide onset of the Internet, Intranet and Extranet as part of the global and national information superhighways."
2484,"These will be evolved to carry mail, finance and banking, electronic commerce and all other multimedia communication needs in the shortest possible time at the least cost; Quickly collect, compile and reformat all official records, especially those which have a direct bearing on the country’s economic progress and the average citizen’s interaction with Governmental agencies, into a usable electronic format; Network, through the Internet, Intranet, Extranet, local area networks and wide area networks, all limbs of the Government to facilitate quick, multiway flow of information amongst ministries, departments and key administrative functionaries."
2485,"This will help the Government work faster, more efficiently and in a more pro-people manner; and, Facilitate our schools, colleges and universities, in all possible ways, to harness the rich knowledge resources available on the Internet to improve the standard of education."
2486,"   Election Manifestoes • 229 Our Policy on Media, Cinema, Arts Freedom with Responsibility WHILE the BJP believes in the traditional Indian position of Ano Bhadraha Kritavayo Yantu Vishwataha (Let noble thoughts come to us from all sides), it equally believes in the Gandhian dictum that we should keep our windows open for fresh air to come in, but keep the walls intact, so that we are not blown off our feet."
2487,This is the guiding principle of the BJP in its approach to the media.
2488,"Consistent with this, the BJP would enact rules to ensure that ownership of the media is in the hands of natural-born Indians only."
2489,"While, a limited extent of 20 per cent foreign equity investment may be allowed in the electronic media in view of its large capital requirements, no investment will be allowed in the other media, including the print media."
2490,"On the use of editorial matter from outside in electronic media, the BJP would ensue that the safeguards present in Article 19 (2. of the Constitution are fully implemented to balance freedoms and public interest."
2491,"Voluntary Normative Standards for Media THE BJP believes that, a healthy polity and democracy cannot survive without the support of an extra-political moral order which the democratic political order cannot itself impose on its citizens."
2492,This belief is also the emerging belief of more advanced democracies that are experiencing a steep slide in morality which is endangering the very idea of orderly society.
2493,"These decaying societies are beginning to understand that no society, especially a democracy, can long endure without the consensus of the majority of its citizens to some normative moral code."
2494,"Within the boundaries of this code, cultural diversity can flourish, outside of which it quickly   230 • Party Document Vol-1 degenerates into a jungle of conflicting special interests enveloped in moral chaos."
2495,"While the world shrinks, India will have to provide against such danger in our society too."
2496,"Fortunately, at the family and social levels, the age-old ‘dharma’, which is distinct from religious practice, acts as an extra-political normative moral order."
2497,But the normative moral order or dharma needs to be protected and preserved as it is already under pressure.
2498,"With this end in view, the BJP will strive for a national consensus with the involvement of all sections of the Indian society for a voluntary moral standard for the media, for the media plays a very important role both in fostering and prejudicing such a moral order."
2499,The inherent idea behind such a moral code may be summarized as under: Promotion of family values and extended family relationships to preserve its character as a basic socio- economic and socio-cultural unit.
2500,"The importance of religious faith in moulding human life, with due understanding that religions should not conflict; nor should there be uniformity."
2501,Projection of regard and respect for women and motherhood.
2502,"Criticism of political parties and personalities, without eroding the self-confidence of the nation."
2503,"Promotion of interest in Indian traditions, history, literature, arts and values as a source of emotional support and as a link with the nation’s past, thus strengthening the civilizational and cultural roots of the country and its people."
2504,Entertainment as an embodiment of the traditional Indian view of ‘Navarasa’ so that it does not degenerate into a source of amoral living.
2505,"Healthy development of an open and scientific mind, the spirit of adventure and patriotism among the youth."
2506,"The BJP will ensure that the rights of free speech of Indian citizens are guaranteed and will promote the availability throughout India of a diverse range of radio and television services offering information, entertainment and education."
2507,"A BJP Government will ensure the development of a non-partisan Indian expression through programmes which, while reflecting Indian attitudes, opinions, ideas, values and artistic creativity would, at the same   Election Manifestoes • 231 time, encourage rational thinking, a scientific temper and lead Indian society to modernity in the 21st century."
2508,This is an indicative and not exhaustive idea on the subject.
2509,The BJP Government will start a nationwide debate on this concept of a voluntary moral code and strive to evolve a consensus.
2510,"To achieve this goal, we will: Improve the provisions of the Prasar Bharati Act to let Prasar Bharati organize an effective public broadcasting system, which would be accountable to Parliament but free from Government control, immune from political influence and sensitive to the diverse needs of Indian society."
2511,"While permitting, by license, the entry of private enterprise and investment in radio and television broadcasting, purely on commercially acceptable terms determined by bids, we will ensure that: (a) The uplinking of television programmes will be from India."
2512,(b) Foreign equity investment in audio-visual media is restricted to 20 per cent.
2513,(c) Management of all types of the media is in Indian hands.
2514,"Ensure, by law, that there are appropriate statutory guidelines for the content of the broadcast in line with the terms of Article 19 (2. of the Constitution of India."
2515,"Ensure and encourage the availability of a variety and plurality of views and diversity in programming by discouraging monopolies and maximizing the number of voices, which can use the mass media."
2516,"We will, therefore, impose appropriate cross-media and cross-platform restrictions and also restriction on investment by media in cable-TV companies and vice-versa."
2517,Facilitate the development of an efficient and competitive Indian broadcasting industry by providing a level playing field to the nascent Indian industry vis-á-vis a highly developed foreign-based broadcasting industry.
2518,Encourage providers of both public and commercial broadcasting services to be responsive to the need for fair and accurate coverage of matters of public interest   232 • Party Document Vol-1 including matters of local significance and respect community standards in the provision of programming.

2527,Freedom of the Press shall be ensured and protected at all costs.
2528,"Cinema POPULAR cinema has played an important role in promoting social harmony and nationalism, apart from providing inexpensive entertainment to the masses."
2529,"However, in recent years, popular cinema, increasingly funded by the underworld, has had a negative impact on society, especially on impressionable young minds."
2530,Sex and violence on the screen are beginning to gnaw at the moorings of our cultural ethos.

2666,Cooperation for the larger good of the nation has been a cornerstone of our civilization.
2667,"Yet, one of the many baneful contributions of the Congress Party to India’s post-Independence polity has been the politics of confrontation and negativism."
2668,"The BJP believes that, in a multi-party democracy like ours, constructive dialogue, consultation and cooperation between the ruling and opposition parties is, not only desirable, but essential."
2669,It has become all the more necessary since several major national issues confronting India today cannot be effectively addressed without evolving a broad platform of national consensus.
2670,Some of the issues where such a national consensus is most urgently called for are: electoral reforms; Centre-State relations; population policy; empowerment of women by legislating 33 per cent reservation for them in all elected bodies; inter-state water disputes; environmental protection; and effective institutional guarantees for the welfare of the weaker sections of society in the course of economic reforms.
2671,"Specifically, our Party and Government shall do the following: We shall not practice ‘political untouchability’ vis-á-vis any party; In all issues of national importance where a national consensus is needed, we shall adopt a policy of dialogue and consultation with other political parties; The consultative mechanisms and procedures in Parliament, towards which the Congress Party always had a casual or contemptuous attitude, will be revived; and,   Election Manifestoes • 241 We shall actively seek the views, suggestions and, wherever feasible, participation of citizens and organizations outside the sphere of politics."
2672,"An equally important dimension of democracy and nation- building, which the Congress Party totally neglected in the past five decades, is the need to build a responsible citizenry."
2673,"Democracy is not only about rights, but also about responsibilities and duties."
2674,"However, since the rulers themselves threw their responsibilities to the winds and turned Statecraft into crass commerce and politics into an unscrupulous power game, the average Indian naturally became cynical about politics."
2675,"His awareness about his responsibilities as a citizen weakened and, to that extent, his conscious contribution to nation-building also diminished."
2676,"As the adage Raja kaalasya kaaranam (The ruler is responsible for the times) reminds us, the blame for this sad of State of affairs rests with the Raja and not the Praja."
2677,"The BJP pledges that, when it is in power, the people will see a qualitative change in the culture of governance."
2678,There will be a marked change in the mindset and behavior of those in Government.
2679,Their duties and responsibilities will take precedence over their perquisites.
2680,"Though such a change in the culture and content of governance is the first prerequisite for building a New India, it alone is not enough."
2681,"A change in the mindset and behavior of citizens in their daily lives is also equally necessary for building a strong, prosperous and proud nation."
2682,"On the occasion of the Swarna Jayanti of our Independence, therefore, the BJP makes the following appeal to every Indian to inculcate the spirit of the Freedom Movement: ‘We, the people of India, shall not discriminate on the basis of caste, creed, class, gender, language, or region in any of our actions and decisions in life."
2683,"Instead, we shall behave with all our compatriots in the belief that we all are equal children of Bharat Mata.’ ‘We, the people of India, whichever profession or vocation we are in, shall work with honesty, dedication and discipline in the spirit of a New Work Culture.’ ‘We, the people of India, shall always give priority to our patriotic duties and responsibilities over narrow self- interest, even as we zealously strive for the realization of our rights enshrined in the Constitution.’    The BJP’s Appeal to Dear Countrymen TO translate this manifesto into reality, we appeal to our all compatriots to vote for the BJP and its allies to power in the elections to the 12th Lok Sabha."
2684,A moment comes when the right choice can change the course of a nation’s history.
2685,"This is the moment to make a decisive choice between the BJP and a decrepit, morally bankrupt Congress; between the BJP and opportunist parties that have no ideological conviction like the Janata Dal and the Samajwadi Party; and between the BJP and the Communist parties who have a hideous history of betrayal of the national interest at every crucial juncture."
2686,In the coming election: • The choice is between stability and another mid-term election soon.
2687,• The choice is between an able Prime Minister and prime ministerial pretenders.
2688,• The choice is between a Government that will change the life of every Indian for the better or one that will make a bad condition still worse.
2689,• The choice is between nationalism and a Foreign Hand.
2690,The BJP gives a solemn assurance to the people of India: ‘We shall sincerely strive to fulfill all the commitments set out in the manifesto.
2691,"If the BJP is voted to power, the India that enters the 21st century and the next millennium, will be an India that will hold her head high and whose citizens will be enjoying the long-awaited fruits of progress made possible by a Government committed to Su-raj (good governance)."
2692,"Guided by a 10-year perspective, our Government will aim to achieve what others could not in the last fifty years."
2693,Our victory will be people’s victory.
2694,It will be the victory of Bharat Mata.’    BJP’s 10-Point Freedom Charter We’ll do in 10 years what others couldn’t in 1.

2706,"     Election Manifesto Election Manifesto 1996 1996     Our Vision, Our Faith, Our Commitment It is out of the past that the future is moulded."
2707,"It is the past that becomes the future... —Swami Vivekananda Even as this century draws to a close and the millennium to ins, India stands at a critical crossroad of history."
2708,Centuries’ old hopes and aspirations of our people yearn for a true expression.
2709,The destiny of our land and its people cries for fulfilment.
2710,At such crucial turns historical choices are made and instruments of change adopted.
2711,That destined vehicle of change is the Bharatiya Janata Party.
2712,Never before in the long history of our land has the country been governed by such a morally rudderless and financially corrupt regime.
2713,Seldom have our trusting people been duped by a baser band.
2714,"With the people’s hopes belied and their aspirations thwarted, our ancient land stands today face to face with the option of a real change, a chance for a true departure from the last 50 years of Congress misrule, an alternative and an option: The Bharatiya Janata Party."
2715,Our people are looking towards the BJP to become just this instrument of change.
2716,The party is ready to shoulder this great duty and responsibility.
2717,"The task is nothing short of rekindling the lamp of our eternal ‘Dharma’, that Sanatan thought which our sages bequeathed to mankind — a social system based on compassion, cooperation, justice, freedom, equality and tolerance."
2718,"To reallse this goal, the BJP will launch a new social, economic   248 • Party Document Vol-1 and political order."
2719,"It will strive to transform the existing system of governance, to make it responsive and answerable to the concerns of our citizens."
2720,It will strive to make the economy cater to the largest demands of the largest number.
2721,The party will endeavour to place in the service of the nation a political organisation that is conscientious and clean.
2722,"Above all, the BJP will secure for India a place in the comity of nations which befits its vast cultural, intellectual, economic, scientific and human wealth."
2723,"We realise that correcting the mistakes of the last 50 years of Congress misrule, of piecing together the shattered dreams of our citizens, of restructuring our polity which has been delivered a body blow by the present regime, of restoring 10 the state’s authority and reviving faith in the Government, is by no means an easy task."
2724,"But we also realise that only the BJP has the ideological commitment, moral conviction and political courage to shoulder this task and gently guide our nation into the next millennium."
2725,"The present millennium began with the subjugation of our ancient land; let a reinvigorated, proud, prosperous and strong India herald the next millennium."
2726,"In this noble mission, we shall be guided by our Manifesto — it contains our commitments to the nation and its citizens."
2727,"Our state governments in Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Delhi have demonstrated that for the BJP, these commitments constitute a sacred covenant with the people."
2728,We do what we say.
2729,This Manifesto shall be the covenant of our government.
2730,"With a BJP Government at the Centre, the next five years will be devoted to implementing our Manifesto based on the four concepts of Suraksha, Shuchita, Swadeshi and Samrasata."
2731,"Hindutva, or cultural nationalism, shall be the rainbow which will bridge our present to our glorious past and pave the way for an equally glorious future; it will guide the transition from Swarajya to Surajya."
2732,"Our Manifesto reflects the application of these four concepts in good governance and their role in moulding the nation we dreamt of on the dawn of Independence — a prosperous and strong India, a country where every citizen regards this land of ours, this Bharatbhoomi, that stretches from   Election Manifestoes • 249 the Indus to the seas, as his sacred motherland."
2733,"The BJP believes in one nation, one people, and one culture."
2734,"We are, therefore, committed to promoting social reconciliation rather than conflict."
2735,"We are resolved to put an end to the politics of competitive communalism, of appeasement, and of casteism."
2736,"The politics of pitting caste against caste, community against community and class against class has torn asunder our social fabric."
2737,The BJP will reweave this fabric into a harmonious pattern.
2738,"   250 • Party Document Vol-1 Our Nation, Our State, Our Government A New Direction, A New Dispensation."
2739,Nearly half a century of Congress misrule has all but shattered the internal polity of the country.
2740,There is not one institution of the Republic left that can be said to now be in a state of total health.
2741,"The Legislature, the Executive, unfortunately the Judiciary, and even the media have been afflicted by the mindlessness of the Congress’ exploitation and loot of our country."
2742,The Bharatiya Janata Party well recognises that to correct this great wrong of the past five decades requires the skill and commitment of a Vishwakarma.
2743,"With humility, we address ourselves to this task."
2744,The first is to restore to our state its authority.
2745,Perhaps never since the scourge of the Pindaries has the writ of our state been as enfeebled as by this Congress misrule.
2746,"The primary task, therefore, is to restore to the state, and to governance, its honour and its prestige — izzat and iqbal."
2747,For this the BJP will institute a set of measures.
2748,This is a challenge that is principally moral and only then functional.
2749,"The BJP commits itself, therefore, to: Addressing purposefully to the many challenges being posed to us in Jammu & Kashmir and in the North-East of India."
2750,"We are of the view that in both these strategically important border regions of the country, misgovernance, neglect and emotional separation from India lie at the root of the problems."
2751,Terrorism and challenges to the state will be met forthrightly; changes in law where warranted will be brought about expeditiously; the approach will be firm but always fair.
2752,"Election Manifestoes • 251 To translate this Manifesto into reality, to fulfil our destined role of leading India into the next millennium, the Bharatiya Janata Party seeks the support and cooperation of all our citizens."
2753,Launching a major nationwide drive to identify influx of illicit arms and their possession.
2754,Proliferation of small arms affects directly the law and order in the country as also the security of the nation.
2755,We recognise that narcotics smuggling and narco-terrorism are linked.
2756,The country must be rid of both.
2757,The law in this regard will be made more effective and implemented.
2758,"Toning up the administration (as enumerated subsequently) and reforming its functioning, accountability and responsibilities."
2759,"Rationalising the number, structure, composition and role of paramilitary forces, including recent initiatives like National Security Guard (NSG), Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Special Protection Group (SPG)."
2760,We will review the personal security arrangments: We believe that the security of the high dignitaries of the country is the responsibility of the state.
2761,"This security, however, should neither be exaggerated nor intrusive."
2762,It should not ever be at the cost of the collective convenience of the citizens of the country.
2763,The BJP will reform this.
2764,"An Agenda for Change Constitutional Reforms The BJP believes that Centre-State relations, which have been on a downslide for the past 50 years, need to be improved."
2765,We also believe that reforms are needed for a stronger Union and equal rights for all citizens.
2766,"The BJP will implement the main recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission, such as: (a) Restoring the balance of resources in favour of the States; (b) Ending the misuse of Art 356 to dismiss state governments and dissolve state assemblies."
2767,"We will explore the possibility of making it mandatory for the   252 • Party Document Vol-1 Union Government to seek Parliament’s approval by two-thirds majority for dismissal of state governments and, (c) Consulting state governments before appointing Governors."
2768,"We promise to carve out Uttaranchal, Vananchal, Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh and give them full statehood."
2769,We will further consider setting up a commission to examine the formation of smaller states.
2770,Delhi will be given full statehood.
2771,"The BJP will provide Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh in J&K state with regional development councils."
2772,"We will abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, which puts Jammu & Kashmir on a separate and separatist pedestal, for the state’s full and final integration with the Union."
2773,We will set up an inter-state council under Article 263 of the Constitution to settle all inter-state and Centre-State disputes to avoid ad hoc responses to issues like that of Cauvery waters.
2774,The BJP is committed to Article 44 of the Constitution.
2775,"We will adopt a Uniform Civil Code which will be applicable to every community and foster a common Bharatiya identity, apart from ensuring gender equality."
2776,Regressive personal laws will cease to have legal validity.
2777,The manner of appointment of constitutional functionaries will be reviewed.
2778,We will maintain a national register of citizens and introduce a multipurpose identity card.
2779,"Electoral Reforms The BJP carries a conviction that amongst the many causes that have brought the state of our polity to its present plight, a major factor is faulty elections."
2780,"We will, therefore, immediately on assuming office, implement various electoral reforms."
2781,"For free, fair and fearless elections, the BJP will: Update and adopt the Goswami Committee report; Grant statutory status to the Code of Conduct drawn up   Election Manifestoes • 253 by the Election Commission and give it teeth; Introduce a scheme of state-funding of candidates to all legislatures; Provide suitable incentives for open, official corporate funding to all recognised political parties; Undertake fresh delimitation of Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies on the basis of the 1991 census; Make it mandatory for political parties to submit audited accounts for public scrutiny annually; Examine the feasibility of introducing the list system; Expedite the process of issuing identity cards to all voters and make it a mandatory requirement for voting; Scrutinise all voters’ lists to ensure that no legitimate voter is excluded; Take steps to curb expenditure on elections by imposing a ban on advertisements, cutouts, etc; Introduce electronic voting machines to hasten the process of counting; Examine the possibility of simultaneous elections to the Parliament, State Assemblies and Panchayats; Ensure speedy and exemplary punishment for those who indulge in booth-capturing; Officials found guilty of involvement in poll rigging will be given exemplary punishment; Amend the anti-defection law whereby a member of any Legislature who changes parties will lose his or her membership of the House; and, Prevent the misuse of Doordarshan and A.I.R."
2782,by the ruling party.
2783,Corruption & Its Cure The BJP treats this affliction as the single greatest wrong that the Congress misrule of the past 50 years has brought about on our land.
2784,"The corruption that now corrodes our country is of the spirit, it is moral, and it is also financial."
2785,The challenge thus to governance is principally of setting an example — of impeccable probity and unimpeachable accountability of all public men and women.
2786,"This must not cover simply the elected representatives   254 • Party Document Vol-1 of the people but also the executive, the police and, indeed, even the judiciary, where the touch of corruption can easily be felt."
2787,"The BJP will address itself to this challenge and task, by adopting measures that are mentioned here."
2788,We do not claim that this is either the ultimate blueprint for the reduction of corruption or the last word on it.
2789,"It is an expression of our commitment; a first step to setting right a very great wrong of many years’ malignancy; a beginning and that, too, with ourselves."
2790,"For a clean public life in which morality and ethics find due recognition, the BJP will: Make it obligatory on every elected representative to make, public his entire income and wealth within 90 days of election; Introduce extensive regulations and requirements upon those who hold public office so that no conflict of interest is ever permitted to influence a proper discharge of their duties; Appoint a Lok Pal to entertain complaints of corruption against anybody holding public office, including the Prime Minister; Take measures to modify and reform the methodology of government approval for contracts, schemes and large money value agreements so as to make them more transparent."
2791,"The powers of patronage, the right to say ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to simple daily requirements of the citizens will be reduced drastically."
2792,"A government that intrudes the least, we hold, governs the best."
2793,"We will endeavour to combine this with open and transparent governance; Expeditiously deal with cases of corruption unresolved and in which no action has been taken in the past 10 years; Take steps to ensure that investigative and intelligence agencies like RAW, IB and CBI are not used to subserve the political designs of the ruling party."
2794,"Judicial Reforms For speedy, fair and inexpensive justice, the BJP will: Appoint special judges to clear the huge arrears at all levels of the judiciary; Fill the vacancies in the High Courts and the Supreme   Election Manifestoes • 255 Court without any further delay; Legislate to the effect that courts do not give unending adjournments and complete cases within one year."
2795,"Constantly review the salaries and pension benefits of all judges so as to attract the best legal talent to the judiciary; Expand and strengthen the existing legal aid facilities for economically weaker sections of the society; and, Set up a National Judicial Commission which will be responsible for making judicial appointments in the High Courts and the Supreme Court."
2796,"Panchayati Raj For better local self-governance at the village-level, the BJP will: In the light of recent experience, make changes in the Constitution 73rd and 74th amendments to further strengthen the Panchayati Raj system; and, Endeavour to make the panchayats financially self-sufficient."
2797,"Administrative Reforms For a caring, just and accountable administration, to provide high quality services the citizens value and for a new paradigm in public administration, the BJP will: Make the district administration accountable for any outbreak of violence; institute a time-bound inquiry; publish the findings; punish the guilty; and, compensate the victims; Update and implement the National Police Commission report in a time-bound manner; Ask each Ministry/Department to set clear performance standards, including cost consciousness, in quantifiable terms and monitor the adherence to these standards; Introduce a scheme of fixed minimum tenure for some identified posts at higher ranks, e.g."
2798,"Chief Secretaries, Secretaries to Government, DGPs, etc; Disfavour extensions to bureaucrats and police officers; Institute an annual Sardar Patel award for the best three district officers, as a beginning; Ensure uniform housing and other related facilities for   256 • Party Document Vol-1 officers in the same grade and in the same station."
2799,"The system of allotment of houses will be made transparent; Introduce a system of allowing lateral entry of personnel from the private sector, NGOs, educational/research institutes into government; Identify areas from which government must withdraw so that departments can be wound up in a phased manner; Strengthen the department of administrative reforms at the Centre and in the States; and, Give the citizens what is their due."
2800,"A huge divide today separates the citizen, the society and the state."
2801,"This is principally on account of the state not treating the rights of the citizens as sacrosanct; not fulfilling its obligations towards the citizens sincerely; and, not providing to the citizens the services that are its bounden duty."
2802,"The BJP will, therefore, identify such areas as warrant immediate correction, as they affect the daily life of the ordinary citizen, and implement reforms in them within a given timeframe."
2803,"Shri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya The BJP is committed to the concept of one nation, one people, one culture — our nationalist vision is not merely bound by the geographical or political identity of India, but defined by our ancient cultural heritage."
2804,From this belief flows our faith in ‘Cultural Nationalism’ which is the core of Hindutva.
2805,"That, we believe, is the identity of our ancient nation — Bharatvarsha."
2806,Hindutva is a unifying principle which alone can preserve the unity and integrity of our nation.
2807,"It is a collective endeavour to protect and re-energise the soul of India, to take us into the next millennium as a strong and prosperous nation."
2808,Hindutva is also the antidote to the shameful efforts of any section to benefit at the expense of others.
2809,"We hold that only by recognising the limitless strength of cultural nationalism, can the nation be moulded."
2810,"When the BJP joined the movement for the construction of the Shri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, it was to strengthen just these foundations."
2811,"On coming to power, the BJP Government will facilitate the   Election Manifestoes • 257 construction of a magnificent Shri Ram Mandir at Janmasthan in Ayodhya which will be a tribute to Bharat Mata."
2812,This dream moves millions of people in our land; the concept of Rama lies at the core of their consciousness.
2813,"   258 • Party Document Vol-1 Our Economy, Action And Direction Economic Growth and Employment Through Swadeshi Four decades of Congress misrule have ruined the economic creativity of our country; these decades failed to place the country on a sound economic footing, befitting India’s stature as the largest democracy in the world."
2814,"The experiments of the Congress, with vastly divergent models, have brought the country, from time to time, to the brink of crisis."
2815,"The passive victim of all these experiments has been the long suffering citizen of our country; even as under- nourishment, malnutrition, illiteracy and deprivation afflict a large percentage of them; even as the quality of life gets fractured between India and Bharat."
2816,We commit ourselves to bringing certainty in economic policy.
2817,The Bharatiya Janata Party is proud of India’s heritage and has an abiding faith in the creative genius of every Indian.
2818,We are committed to an economy that enables India to achieve its destiny in the forefront of the nations of the world.
2819,"In 1991, the present government claimed that it inherited an economy which had a slender foreign exchange reserves."
2820,"Accepting IMF conditionalities, it initiated a programme of deregulation of industry, trade and exchange rate policies, a radically different approach to foreign investment."
2821,"The consequential foreign exchange reserves that it will be leaving, as a legacy to the successor government, are, however, fragile, being composed mainly of quick-sand components of foreign institutional investments and FCNR deposits."
2822,Foreign direct investment (FDI) is only a minor component of them.
2823,An enormous $7 billion becomes ripe for debt servicing in 1996-97 itself.
2824,"In its zeal to contain fiscal deficits task in which it failed, the fiscal deficit continuing around 7% of GDP—it   Election Manifestoes • 259 pruned developmental expenditure beyond acceptable limits, in consequence constraining growth."
2825,"Despite the proclaimed deregulation, over the past five years, all earlier structures and institutions of the License Quota-Permit Raj remain intact."
2826,Social infrastructure has been neglected and the lot of the poor and deprived has further deteriorated.
2827,"The country’s defence requirements were also neglected, thereby putting the nation’s security in jeopardy."
2828,"The neglect of infrastructure by this government has left a legacy of a fractured physical infrastructure—roads, railways, post, power, telecom—are grinding to near immobility, in the process constraining growth elsewhere in the economy."
2829,"In its methodology for containing the budget through limits on monetisation of the deficit, this government has compulsorily resorted to heavy borrowings, which in turn, has resulted in liquidity to the rest of the economy and a heating up of the interest rates."
2830,"Our domestic industry, starved of liquidity, is in danger of slipping into recession."
2831,"In totality, this government will leave an economy more fragile and shattered than what it inherited in 1991."
2832,"The challenges thus, to us in our bid at governance, are formidable."
2833,"Our Economic Thought In outlining our strategy, we recognise that the post Cold War world has adopted the market place for fast economic growth."
2834,"However, our thought is defined by the following: (i) Market may ensure growth, but it cannot ensure redistribute equity and justice."
2835,"The state continues to have a role to play; (ii) The poor and deprived have, therefore, to be helped by the state to cross the poverty line and to attain a sustainable minimum quality of life; (iii) On the economic front, the old order, based on comparative advantage of labour or resources, is giving way to a new order built on the basis of human resources, skills and technology."
2836,"A proper policy can make it India’s strength; and (iv) A society such as ours has to innovate its own strategy,   260 • Party Document Vol-1 to adapt to the high-tech challenges of a supposedly borderless world, without the attendant social stresses, economic instability and the abandonment either of its identity or of its own socio-cultural ethos."
2837,"This is the essence of our Swadeshi approach: A self-reliant India, asserting its national economic interests, not as autarchy, but as a pre-requisite to meeting the challenge of globalisation; of preserving our identity without compromising our sovereignty or self respect."
2838,We reject unbridled consumerism and believe in adherence to sustainable consumption and growth.
2839,Foreign investment will be required and encouraged for world class technology.
2840,"But when foreign savings have to supplement and assist the economy in circumstances where domestic savings are inadequate, we compromise with the nation’s long term interests."
2841,"While many countries which started late but arrived much earlier than India, managed their growth on savings levels around 35-40% of GDP, the Indian domestic savings rate has steadily declined to a low level of 20% of GDP during Congress rule."
2842,"This is grossly inadequate for even the current level of investment, let alone the levels required for a faster growth of the economy."
2843,"Not only have private savings declined, more worrisomely, governmental savings are now virtually nil."
2844,"We recognise two immediate priorities—first, providing the physical and economic infrastructure that is appropriate for the stipulated growth in our GDP; second, providing the required social infrastructure for a minimum sustainable quality of life."
2845,To attain these and yet contain fiscal deficit requires a different approach.
2846,"The BJP will work towards pruning non-developmental expenditure; minimise the commercial activities of government; severely cutting back on bureaucracy; shedding the structures of controls and regulation; and re-equipping itself for its new role of providing a framework for free market operations for growth, accentuating programmes for poverty eradication and social Infrastructure."
2847,Election Manifestoes • 261 Fiscal Reform and Taxation We believe that taxation alone cannot be the base for revenue.
2848,A stable and fast growth is possible only through a high order of investment matched by an appropriate level of domestic savings.
2849,The present government has done a great disservice by encouraging avoidable consumerism and diverting the depleted savings into speculative rather than safe and productive channels.
2850,"• We will structure our fiscal reforms so that savings and contracted savings are augmented to levels that will take care of a higher order of investment needed for faster growth; • In taxation, we will ensure that not only levels and rates of taxation are such that growth is not constrained, but that the burden-sharing of taxes is equitably distributed among all affluent sections of society."
2851,We will mitigate the undue rigours of indirect taxes—today indirect taxes constitute 71 % of tax revenue—so that productivity and growth are not hampered.
2852,We will devise a suitably structured valued added tax (VAT) so as to ensure better burden-sharing among ‘goods and services’ that contribute to value addition.
2853,"• In tariffs we will ensure that the domestic sector gets a level playing field, and does not become uncompetitive; • We will also strive to lighten the debt burden on the nation."
2854,"This in turn will contribute to interest rate stabilisation; • We will not hike Excise Duties on items of mass consumption; • We will examine the aspect of sales tax reform and equalisation; • We will ensure operational autonomy of the RBI; • We will adopt firm measures to prevent the generation of black money; • We will rationalise and simplify the present tax structure and raise the Income Tax exemption limit to ₹ 60,000; • We will provide weighted deductions taking number of dependents on earning member; • We will exempt all investments in approved organisations, private OR public, from the levy of Wealth Tax;   262 • Party Document Vol-1 • We will give tax reliefs to employment-oriented industries in non-municipal areas; • We will ensure minimum contribution to government exchequer by all profit-earning business units."
2855,"The concept of ‘zero business units’ will be done away with; • We will give special tax concessions to writers, artists, academics and others engaged in intellectual and cultural pursuits."
2856,Price Stability and Consumer Protection It is our firm belief that the price level can be controlled only through maximisation of production and a minimisation of costs of production.
2857,"This is to be achieved through technology upgradation, economics of scale and free competition."
2858,"Towards this end, the BJP will: • Ensure an efficient, low-cost, corruption-free PDS, so that there is a regular, assured, timely and adequate supply of commodities to the consumers in the rural, tribal, remote and backward areas of our country; • Supply better quality foodgrains through the PDS by enhancing the norms for quality standards rather than easing them as has been done by the Congress; • Make pulses, cooking oil and soap also available through PDS, in addition to food-grains, sugar and kerosene; • Improve the Consumer Protection Act of 1986, and ensure its application; and, • Encourage consumer movements."
2859,"Black Money and Corruption Starting from its Jana Sangh days, the BJP has been waging a relentless battle against the twin evils of corruption and black money."
2860,"We are committed to rooting out corruption, thus also the malignancy of black money."
2861,"• We will encourage capital creation through funds from such a parallel economy, retaining the right of government to tax the revenue flows from such created capital."
2862,"• The BJP will open up sectors such as social forestry, wasteland development and housing for rural and urban poor."
2863,"• We will also review the rationale of the Urban Land Ceiling Election Manifestoes • 263 Act, in this context."
2864,"Infrastructure We hold that power, telecommunications, transport (surface, sea and air) constitute the basic building blocks of our development."
2865,"With hardly 50% of the roads surfaced, about 40% of the traffic volume is handled by the National Highway System (NHS) which constitutes hardly 2% of the road network."
2866,Our Railway network has grown only by 16% over five decades.
2867,The ports have become the greatest constraint on our world trade.
2868,The dimensions of the power and telecommunications situation cripple development.
2869,"• We need to actively develop a National Waterways network; • To meet our minimum needs, a staggering 10,000 MW have to be added annually for the next 15 years."
2870,Irrigation needs press upon our resources.
2871,All these call for large investments.
2872,"• We propose, therefore, to lay the foundations of a strong bond market in the country which can take care of the massive financial requirements."
2873,We invite foreign capital in the field of infrastructure.
2874,• We will initate a framework which will facilitate quick redressal of the acute infrastructure crisis based on international co-operation and partnership.
2875,"• We will strive to confine the role of the state to that of a facilitator, withdrawing in favour of suitably structured independent regulatory authorities."
2876,Public Sector At present the policy relating to public sector is in disarray.
2877,"• The BJP believes in confining the public sector only to sensitive areas where the nation’s security is involved and to areas where the presence of public sector is necessary for providing a moderating or counter-poising role to the ill effects, if any, of an unchecked private sector."
2878,• Public sector presence will continue in areas furthering social objectives.
2879,• The remaining public sector that would continue will be   264 • Party Document Vol-1 managed with the least interference by government.
2880,"In the case of disinvestment from ailing, non-profitable or sick public sector undertakings, the BJP will constitute a Disinvestment Commission for taking care of disinvestment from the country’s public sector."
2881,"• While disinvesting, care will be taken so that the workers’ interests are not harmed."
2882,• The National Renewal Fund will be realigned to take care of the constant requirements of retraining and redeployment of workers that may be necessary in a fast growing economy.
2883,• Sales proceeds from PSU disinvestment will be utilised only on capital expenditure.
2884,Foreign Trade and Capital Foreign Trade Policy has in the past degenerated into one of providing palliatives.
2885,It has now become necessary to strengthen the interface between industry and trade.
2886,"• We will select core industries and a system of destinations and initiate an integrated production for export planning with selective intervention so that this sector, so vital to the economy, acquires dynamism."
2887,• We will also strive to forge such alliances with or memberships of regional trading blocs that will give further impetus to our exports.
2888,"The BJP welcomes foreign investment, because we hold that it supplies knowledge, technology and know-how and sharpens the quality and competitive edge of our economy."
2889,"• We will, however, strive to minimise our dependence on foreign savings."
2890,• We will prioritise foreign investment in sectors that will promote exports in preference to sectors that will cater solely or exclusively to the domestic market.

2893,"• As for MNCs in consumer non-durables, we do not consider them as areas of priority."
2894,"Industrial Policy Industry in India has to be enabled to become more productive, more innovative."

2896,"For, we ecognise this inseperable interdependence."
2897,"Our exports must compete with the best in the world, add to our resources and fiscal health, and thus enable India to achieve the status that we believe is its destiny."
2898,The BJP assures all about creating a healthy investment and industrial environment.
2899,The BJP believes in the continued role and relevance of the small-scale sector.
2900,"This important segment of our national economy, which has been entirely ignored by the Congress and whose very existence is threatened by the present policy of economic liberalisation, will receive all encouragement and help from a BJP Government."
2901,The following principles will guide the industrial policy of the BJP: A.
2902,Economic Sovereignty The party regards the preservation of the nation’s economic interests as a component of our external economic relations.
2903,"Globalisation, to us, is not a synonym for the obliteration of national economic interests."
2904,"Indeed, in the ensuing global competition we need to be constantly mindful of preserving them."
2905,"B. Modernisation BJP stands for a mode 24 and progressive India, open to new ideas, new technology and fresh capital."
2906,A modern India to the BJP is not a westernised India; a pale copy of the western economic models.

2908,The BJP stands for political as well as economic democracy.

2915,The BJP proposes to introduce a scheme of voluntary National Service to undertake the task of national reconstruction and also in order to instill a sense of discipline and nationalism among the youth of the country.
2916,"This service will aim at reclaiming wasteland for commercial use—for instance, after reclaiming the waste land, it will be used for horticulture, social forestry or any other purpose that will provide the youth involved in the reclamation with continued income."
2917,"Similarly, the National Service will be used for river management schemes."
2918,"Apart from this, the BJP proposes to: Increase employment opportunities in all sectors of the organised economy; Introduce policies and programmes to: (i) Develop agriculture, particularly in regions which are at present less developed and backward."

2929,"Government Employees BJP will set up a permanent Employees Welfare Board with a view to resolving the long-standing problems related to: Time scale promotion; Revision of pay scales and award of bonus; Implementation of awards; Housing; and, Social welfare measures and travel concession for retired  personnel."
2930,"Election Manifestoes • 269 Our Scientific Talent, Our Technology Harnessing Nature For Human Welfare The BJP believes that science and technology must play its due role in transforming India into a prosperous and strong country."
2931,"The BJP will apply appropriate scientific and technological methods for increasing productivity, eradicating poverty, hunger and disease and providing meaningful employment along with the basic amenities of life."
2932,We believe that science and technology need to be harnessed to improve the lot of the vast section of our population living below the poverty line.
2933,We hold that science is not merely harnessing nature for material wealth but is as well for liberating and enriching the mind and enlarging the human spirit.
2934,The BJP will use science in the service of the poor and develop technology that has a humane face.
2935,"Towards this end, we will: Foster a scientific temper among the people; Use science and technology for increasing productivity and generating employment; Implement a vigorous programme of science education and research for improving quality of life; Establish a network of centres for application of science and technology to rural areas, implement ‘lab-to-land’ programmes and develop a strong low-cost agro-Industrial base; Put new life into National Laboratories to develop them as centres of excellence in applied research; Direct these laboratories to evolve appropriate technology for Indian needs; Accelerate the production of scientific literature in regional   270 • Party Document Vol-1 languages and evolve a national terminology for science and technology; Create the right working conditions for our best brains to remain in India and serve the country and not migrate to other lands; Make a systematised effort to bring national laboratories and industry together by setting up ‘Technology Parks’ to be patronised by industry."

2939,"To meet them, to benefit from the opportunities, mindful of the existing global disequilibrium and in consonance with India’s national interests, our foreign policy in the emerging decades will be based on the human values of peace, equality and cooperation."
2940,"The BJP holds that as a departure from the recent past, Indian diplomacy should be conducted in tune with India’s position as a strong power and a major player in the world arena."
2941,A billion people who do not depend upon anyone for feeding or clothing themselves are a power which cannot be ignored.

2946,The BJP does not accept outside interference in this region as being beneficial for it.
2947,Pakistan continues to follow a policy of fomenting insurgency seeking to create instability and unrest in India.

2949,"In this context, we state: (a) The BJP affirms unequivocally India’s sovereignty over   272 • Party Document Vol-1 the whole of Jammu & Kashmir, including Pakistan occupied Kashmir; and, (b) The BJP declares that it will not accept any interference in our country’s internal affairs."
2950,Our relations with the USA will be based on mutual respect and a congruence of interests.
2951,"We note, however, that US policy for this region continues to suffer from lack of vision and that it disregards India’s political and security interests."
2952,India and Russia have a long tradition of good relations and have much to gain from the compatibility of their geopolitical interests in Asia.
2953,The BJP will endeavour to further explore the avenues of bilateral cooperation in this direction.
2954,Our relations with the People’s Republic of China offer an opportunity to now put them on a footing of friendship and cooperation.
2955,For this we need to resolve the border question in a fair and equitable manner.
2956,"It cannot, however, be ignored that the People’s Republic of China continues to support Pakistan militarily and otherwise."
2957,"The BJP greatly regrets the continuing bloodshed in Sri Lanka, particularly as India all through its history has had warm fraternal ties with all sections of the population in that country."
2958,The BJP is confident that within a united Sri Lanka it should be possible to fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil people.
2959,"The BJP pledges to maintain warm and friendly relations with Nepal, with which India has the closest cultural, religious and historical ties."
2960,The BJP will work actively for resolving all outstanding issues.
2961,We welcome the restoration of democracy in Nepal.
2962,The BJP views with great sympathy the struggle for restoration of democracy in Myanmar.
2963,"It extends its support to the task of reconciliation and reconstruction in that country with which India has a long border and age-old religious, cultural and historical ties."
2964,The BJP will try to consolidate further the close and friendly ties between India and Bhutan.
2965,"Election Manifestoes • 273 In our relations with Bangladesh, illegal immigration into India from that country has proved a major irritant."
2966,This issue has cast its shadow on our bilateral ties and needs to be resolved early.
2967,"Millions of sons and daughters of Mother India, settled abroad as Overseas Indians, are considered by the BJP as an asset to the country."
2968,Their emotional attachment to the motherland is still deep.
2969,This must find due expression.
2970,Schemes will be drawn up to attract substantial investments by non-resident Indians.
2971,"They will be welcome to set up industrial units and industrial parks, and invest in the infrastructure."
2972,The BJP will examine afresh the issue of dual citizenship.
2973,The BJP will launch a vigorous campaign for a permanent membership for India in the UN Security Council.
2974,"The BJP stands committed to peace amongst all nations; prosperity for all the peoples of the world; and, an international role for India that befits this great and ancient nation."
2975,"   274 • Party Document Vol-1 Our Nation’s Security Protecting Our Country The BJP accords the highest importance to the security of our Nation, our Society and our Citizens."
2976,"We charge the present government with imperilling our security, internal and external, as never before."
2977,Our defence expenditure has been cut steadily in real terms during the Narasimha Rao regime.
2978,This has seriously compromised our combat effectiveness.
2979,"The present Congress government has been functioning without a full-time Defence Minister for over three years, and this negligence of India’s sword arm has begun to affect the morale of our gallant forces."
2980,The BJP will correct this damaging imbalance.
2981,We will accord due importance to all security related issues — the emerging global realities and regional complexities demand this as the very minimum response from our government.
2982,Internal Security The nature of the state and its relationship with society has a direct bearing on the level of the citizens’ national commitment.
2983,An insensitive and uncaring state erodes the citizens’ allegiance to the nation.
2984,The BJP will restore national commitment to its rightful place by establishing a harmonious relationship between state and society.
2985,"We will: Defuse tension in long-festering trouble spots; Ensure protection of life and property from insurgents and foreign mercenaries; Provide our security apparatus with a free hand to deal with terrorism; Revitalise and reinforce law and order machinery;   Election Manifestoes • 275 Institute police reforms and upgrade the capability of the force; and, Legislate tough deterrent laws against terrorist and disruptive activities (TADA was repealed to pander to vote bank politics) while safeguarding democratic rights."
2986,Jammu & Kashmir The absence of political far-sightedness and clarity of national objectives has resulted in our nation continuing to have to pay a price even 50 years after Jammu & Kashmir became a part of the Republic.
2987,The failure of successive Congress Governments to formulate a Jammu & Kashmir policy that takes into account the State’s internal problems has led to a situation where this strategic border state has emerged as the principal challenge to Indian nationhood.
2988,The BJP realises the magnitude of the challenge and dedicates itself to the task of not only solving the internal problems of the state but also reclaiming the portion of our territory which has been illegally held by Pakistan for nearly five decades.
2989,"Without repeating the mistakes of yesteryears and merely reacting to Pakistan’s moves, we will: Immediately strengthen the civil administration by inducting able and honest administrators; Provide a free hand to our security forces to deal with the menace of terrorism and induction of men and arms from Pakistan, while ensuring that democratic rights are not violated; Cleanse the local police and administration of malcontents who have aligned themselves with the terrorists or are pro-Pakistan; Declare Doda a disturbed area and invoke the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act to prevent this district from becoming a haven for mercenaries and terrorists; Launch a massive welfare programme for all regions of the state and ensure that there is no seepage; Hold free and fair elections in the state after terrorism has been brought under control and every person, including the Pandits who have been forced out of the Valley, is provided with an opportunity to participate in the polls;   276 • Party Document Vol-1 Rehabilitate all persons displaced from terrorism-afflicted areas of Jammu & Kashmir; and, Set up regional councils for Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh."
2990,North-East The north-eastern states of our country continue to suffer from the violence perpetrated by insurgency and ethnic strife.
2991,"Poor governance, a callous administration, seepage of development funds, and Congress’ politics of manipulation have contributed to the alienation of the people and the growth of insurgency."
2992,"In Assam, ULFA and Bodo militants have begun to strike with regularity; in Nagaland and Manipur the NSCN continues with its depredation; and, in Tripura, militant tribal outfits have once again reared their ugly heads."
2993,The tide of illegal immigration from Bangladesh has only worsened the situation.
2994,The BJP will address itself to the problems of our north-eastern States and institute a grievance redressal system monitored from Delhi.
2995,"It will also take the following steps to restore the rule of law in the troubled States: Check the inflow of foreign arms and terrorists from training camps across the border; Strengthen the security apparatus and intelligence network; Provide all citizens with identity cards on a priority basis; Check the narcotics trade and attendant ills in the region; and, Plan and execute an integrated and accelerated economic development programme."
2996,"Himalayas Over the past five decades, our Himalayan bastions have been strategically pierced."
2997,"Despite that, the attitude of successive Congress governments has remained unchanged."
2998,"Strategically, the government has failed to restore a balance there, leave alone regain the initiative."
2999,"In the process, we have also lost large national territories to the People’s Republic of China, thus demonstrating an absence of strategic thought about our Himalayan bastions."
3000,The BJP will evolve a security policy for the Himalayas so that India’s national interests are fully safeguarded.
3001,"Election Manifestoes • 277 External Security We believe that pro-active diplomacy, especially defence diplomacy, coupled with adequate preparedness of our armed forces, is the key to securing our frontiers against aggression."
3002,This requires both strategy and tactics.
3003,"The BJP will: Set up a National Security Council; Re-evaluate the country’s nuclear policy and exercise the option to induct nuclear weapons; Though the BJP stands committed to a nuclear-free world, we cannot accept a world of nuclear apartheid."
3004,(i) The BJP will thus not agree to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) unless there is a simultaneous agreement for a time-bound global elimination of nuclear weapons in their entirety.
3005,(ii) The BJP will not agree to the Fissile Material Control Regime(FMCR).
3006,(iii) The BJP will not agree to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).
3007,Expedite the serial production of Prithvi and make Agni I operational for the deployment of these missiles.
3008,"In addition, hasten the development of Agni II; Immediately upgrade conventional weapons and weapons systems of the armed forces; Strengthen the intelligence-gathering system, inclusive of all intelligence agencies, initiate a Centre-State initiative on intelligence gathering and sharing, step up air surveillance of our territory, and acquire state-of-the-art electronic equipment; Strengthen the Air Force fleet with new generation aircraft; Make a qualitative and quantitative improvement in our naval capabilities; Invest in R&D in areas of defence and missile technology so that we become increasingly self-reliant; Peg defence-related expenditure to real requirements; and, Re-examine the role, structure and composition of the numerous para-military forces and reorganise and reform them."
3009,278 • Party Document Vol-1 Jai Jawan The BJP is rightly proud of our valiant soldiers who have dedicated their lives to defend our nation from external aggressors and internal subversives.
3010,"We believe it is our duty to take care of our serving jawans and look after those who have retired from service, as well as their families."
3011,"To fulfil this duty, the BJP will adopt the following programmes and policies: The terms of service, including pay and allowances, housing, education for children and pension, of all ranks will be improved so as to attract men and women of high calibre."
3012,"The present shortage of men and officers does not have to be met by lowering standards of entry; Widows and dependents of jawans who die in action will receive higher benefits and compensation; Pension disparities will be solved and anomalies sorted out expeditiously; Hospitals for veterans will be set up throughout the country so that no ex-serviceman, irrespective of his rank, is denied medical care; Ex-servicemen’s welfare will be included in the concurrent list; The services of our retired soldiers will be used to the maximum extent possible, especially in insurgency- affected areas."
3013,"Wherever there is a stipulated percentage for employing ex-servicemen, it will be fulfilled; Necessary changes will be made in agricultural and urban tenancy laws to secure the proprietary rights of servicemen; and, District Sainik Boards will be strengthened."
3014,"Illegal Immigration: Demographic Invasion — A Threat to Our Security We believe that illegal immigration from our neighbouring countries, especially Bangladesh, has a direct impact on our nation’s security and has an unsettling effect on our demography."
3015,"Given the sheer dimension of numbers there are as many as 1.7 crore illegal immigrants, the bulk of them Bangladeshis, living in various   Election Manifestoes • 279 parts of the country."
3016,"Illegal immigration is not only transforming the geography, but the sociology, the economy, indeed even the politics of this country."
3017,India is facing an explosive issue.
3018,"If our demographic balance is allowed to be disturbed by inept policies and political considerations, various demographic entities are bound to come in conflict, thus adversely affecting our security environment."
3019,"The invasion of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh has led to an alarming growth in a section of the population in our North-East, in Assam, in West Bengal, parts of Bihar and Delhi."
3020,"In certain areas, a section of the population has grown by almost 100 per cent."
3021,"The BJP proposes to: Complete barbed wire fencing along the India-Bangladesh border, beginning with the plains, to prevent infiltration; Detect illegal immigrants, delete their names from voters’ lists and arrange for their deportation without any further delay; Declare all property deals between Indians and illegal immigrants as null and void; Amend immigration rules and other laws to impose stringent checks on illegal entry into India; and, Expedite the issuance of identity cards to all citizens of the country."
3022,"   280 • Party Document Vol-1 Our Villages, Our Farmers, Our Poor Towards a Revitalised Rural Economy Our country has an abundance of natural resources, fertile lands, flowing rivers, rich mineral deposits and verdant forests."
3023,"More than anything else, we have a large army of farmers that shoulders the onerous task of feeding our people."
3024,"But the wrong priorities of the last 50 years of Congress misrule and the lopsided model of development pursued by policymakers have impoverished vast sections of our farmers, rendering agriculture economically non- viable."
3025,"Worse, bulk of the monies earmarked for infrastructural development, health, education and civic amenities has been canalised to the urban areas despite the fact that the majority of the population lives in villages."
3026,"Less than a quarter of the country’s population, 23.31 per cent, lives in urban areas, compared to the overwhelming 76.69 per cent which lives in villages."
3027,"As many as 71.4 per cent of our people are economically dependent on agriculture: This sector of our economy, therefore, generates the highest employment as well as provides the biggest market."
3028,"Yet, this sector continues to be neglected by Congress policy-makers."
3029,"The Bharatiya Janata Party believes that India cannot emerge as a powerful nation until the lot of our farmers is improved, adequate attention paid to the agricultural sector, an all-out war launched against poverty, and investments are made in agro-industry as well as small-scale and cottage industry catering to the requirements of our villages."
3030,"Our country’s progress is linked to the well-being of our villages, our farmers and our poor."
3031,"Election Manifestoes • 281 Congress’ Policy: Not to Have a Policy on Agriculture In the absence of any well thought out agricultural policy focussing on rural development and reconstruction, agriculture is fast becoming a losing proposition for our farmers."
3032,"While fixing agricultural prices, successive Congress governments have not taken into account the expenses incurred by our farmers on seeds, fertiliser, power, water, pesticides, machinery and labour."
3033,No effort has ever been made to bring about parity in the prices of industrial and agricultural produce.
3034,"As a result, our farmers are forced to sell the fruit of their labour at low prices even while they have to pay ever-increasing prices for the necessary inputs."
3035,"Not surprisingly, this has contributed to the impoverishment and indebtedness of our farmers, pushing vast sections of them dangerously close to or even below the Poverty Line."
3036,"According to the Planning Commission’s own estimates, almost 42 per cent of our rural population lives below the Poverty Line."
3037,"No less alarming is the fact that the number of our villagers dependent on per acre of land has been steadily increasing, compared to other countries where this dependency has dramatically decreased with governments investing in agro-industry which offers alternative sources of employment."
3038,No effort has been made to set up an adequate number of small-scale and cottage industries in our rural areas to absorb idle hands.
3039,This has also contributed in no small measure to the impoverishment of our farmers.
3040,"In 1950-51, the ratio of the disparity between the per capita income in rural and urban areas was 1:2; in 1995-96 it stood at 1:4."
3041,"Similarly, while per family income has risen by 52 per cent in urban areas since 1952, it has increased by a mere 7.8 per cent in rural areas."
3042,"Ironically, these neglected villages form a vast market and from this market, as much as Rs 48,000 crores flow to our urban areas every year."
3043,"By killing our villages, we will be destroying this market."
3044,"Conversely, by developing our villages, we will be strengthening this market, which in turn will benefit our urban areas."
3045,"In other words, urban India cannot survive without rural India."
3046,But this simple truth has been ignored for the last 50 years.
3047,"Today, three out of every four Indians live in villages, condemned to a life of exploitation and increasing social, political and economic   282 • Party Document Vol-1 marginalisation."
3048,"BJP’s Agenda For Our Farmers, Our Poor We pledge to reverse this trend of social, political and economic marginalisation of our rural population and empower our farmers."
3049,We are committed to restoring agriculture to its rightful place and thus steering our people into an era of prosperity and social equality by the opening decade of the new century.
3050,No country can be great if its people remain poor.
3051,Our first task will be to wipe out the dark curse of poverty.
3052,"We will allocate greater resources for effective poverty alleviation programmes; we will invest in agriculture and small-scale industry; we will build from the bottom up, for that is the only way we can build an enduring edifice of development."
3053,"To develop rural India, the BJP will: Allocate 60 per cent of plan funds for agricultural and rural development; Treat villages as the basic unit of development and provide each village with basic facilities like roads, irrigation, drinking water, education, health and sanitation; Provide shelter to the homeless in our villages; Develop agriculture, enhance production and improve living standards in our villages by (a) Fixing agricultural prices after taking into account all expenses incurred by farmers; (b) Reducing the per acre cost of production; (c) Increasing the average per acre production; (d) Reducing the overall dependence on agriculture; (e) Providing alternative employment to displaced farmers; Give agriculture the same benefits as industry; Set up an Agricultural Costs and Prices Commission in which farmers and agricultural specialists will together comprise two-thirds of the members."
3054,"The Commission will be autonomous and its recommendations will be binding; Announce the total cost of inputs, the total expenditure incurred by farmers, and thereafter announce the support prices; Link support prices to the price index;   Election Manifestoes • 283 Ensure parity between agricultural and industrial products in respect of pricing; Conduct extensive research to evolve methods of dryland farming; Give priority to the farmers’ interests while determining the exim policy for agricultural produce; Enforce prompt payment for agricultural produce."
3055,There will be automatic interest addition to payments delayed beyond two weeks; Extend crop and animal insurance to all agricultural produce.
3056,"Insurance schemes will also cover natural calamities; Establish a chain of warehouses with facilities for grant of advance payments of up to 80 per cent of the agricultural produce deposited; Encourage the use of fruit juice in the production of all beverages; Allow free movement of foodgrains throughout the country; Free sugar industry from licensing, and production of molasses from all restrictions on production and movement, as well as ensure that farmers receive an adequate share of the total prices; Maintain the subsidy on fertilisers; Improve the Public Distribution System; Establish farmers’ service centres; Give comprehensive documents to farmers which cover land records, ownership and all other relevant papers; Reform land acquisition laws and ensure that agricultural land acquired for any purpose receives prompt and full compensation at market rates; Free bonded labour and rehabilitate them; and, Launch employment guarantee schemes in rural India that will cover the largest possible number of people."
3057,"To revive village industry, the BJP will: Establish an extensive chain of tiny and small-scale industrial units; Give the greatest impetus to this sector."
3058,"To make agriculture- based sustainable, the BJP will sharpen the edge of agro   284 • Party Document Vol-1 rural industries and food-processing; Provide all facilities, including easy access to credit and marketing to rural artisans and craftsmen; Set up a National Artisan Development Bank; Set up special institutes for skill upgradation; and, Give a thrust to wasteland development, social forestry and horticulture."
3059,"To provide irrigation facilities, the BJP will: Launch time-bound irrigation projects and complete ongoing projects; Give priority to small and minor irrigation projects; Remove disparities between districts within states; Encourage the use of alternative sources of irrigation through incentives and better water management; Ensure that farmers are made to pay only for the water they consume; and, Draw up a master plan for flood control and harnessing of flood waters for irrigation."
3060,Offer prompt compensation for crops lost in floods.
3061,"To provide power for agriculture, the BJP will: Encourage rapid electrification of our villages so that no village is left without power by the turn of the century; Ensure adequate supply of power for agricultural activity; Set up small power stations and sub-stations in rural areas for supplying power exclusively to villages; and, Electricity Boards will be made to pay compensation to farmers if they fail to supply assured quantity of power."
3062,"Similarly, farmers will be required to pay their power bill on time, To strengthen the cooperative movement, the BJP will: Free cooperatives from political interference; Prevent the intrusion of vested interests; Simplify rules and regulations governing the functioning of cooperative societies; Make entry in passbooks mandatory for all money deposits;   Election Manifestoes • 285 Only those entirely dependent on agriculture will be allowed to become members of farmers cooperative societies; and, Ensure free and timely elections to cooperative bodies."
3063,"To implement land reforms, the BJP will: Enforce the implementation of Land Ceiling Laws in all States; Set up designated courts to expeditiously deal with all land ceiling disputes and monitor enforcement of verdicts; Expedite distribution of ceiling surplus land among landless farmers; Monitor the use of distributed land and prevent its alienation from beneficiaries;."
3064,"Reclaim cultivable land lying fallow; Time-bound registration of all lands; and, Decide ownership rights at the level of Gram Panchayats without any delay."
3065,"To alleviate poverty, the BJP will: Enhance public outlays for poverty alleviation and social infrastructure; Restructure the PDS, confining it only to the poor and the needy."
3066,Burgeoning food stocks with a vastly reduced off take and a decline in the per capita consumption of cereals from PDS are powerful indicators of poverty rather than the misleading inflation indices.
3067,PDS prices and the regulated intervals of offtake will be suitably adjusted so that the scheme becomes meaningful for fighting hunger and malnutrition.
3068,"PDS will also be dovetailed to provide ‘Food for Work’ in employment programmes linked with poverty eradication; Identify poverty through indexation reflecting not only the level of consumption of calories but also the minimal social infrastructure status such as literacy, housing, drinking water, health and sanitation; Implement ‘Antyodaya’ schemes throughout the country because we hold that sustainable employment is at the core   286 • Party Document Vol-1 of poverty eradication."
3069,"These Antyodaya schemes will be targeted at the poorest of the poor: Five crore families will be selected for immediate relief; Allocate more resources for food-for-work programmes so that they can be implemented round the year, as well as monitor their implementation; and, Introduce Langar Yojana and Annadan Yojana to ensure that no man, woman or child goes hungry."
3070,"To ensure cow protection, the BJP will: Impose a total ban on the slaughter of cows and cow progeny by amending Article 48 of the Constitution to cover bulls and bullocks, and prohibit all trading (state as well as private) in the slaughter of cows and cow progeny; Implement a policy for improved cattle-breeding; and, Provide tax exemption to the income of Goshalas and Pinjrapoles."
3071,"The BJP recognises the fact that from times immemorial, cow- protection has remained one of the basics of Indian culture and Indian agriculture, and it is on the patient back of the cow and its progeny that the entire structure of Indian agriculture rests."
3072,"Over 70 million animals are employed in farming operations in Indian villages, more than 80% rural transport needs are met by the bullock-cart."

3096,"To ensure an equitable disbursement of resources so that the largest number of our people benefit from development policies, we must arrest the country’s runaway population and growth."

3100,"The Bharatiya Janata Party believes that children are born — and have the right — to be happy, and not merely for existence."
3101,"We will, therefore, put population-related issues, especially family planning, firmly back on the national agenda, and launch a people’s movement against the impending population explosion through persuasive policies."

3107,"This, however, is not for endless exploitation."
3108,"Our environment has to be protected, not only to prevent the sanctity of Mother Earth from being profaned but also because our forests, our rivers and our skies sustain a multitude of lives."
3109,No less important is the crucial role that environment plays in our nation’s security.

3126,"The BJP views the provision of special facilities and special opportunities, including reservations, in the Constitution as practical steps to advance the deprived and under- privileged sections of society."

3139,"Successive Congress governments have not only abdicated their responsibility towards these less fortunate of our citizens, but also resisted their empowerment and, therefore, their inclusion in the national mainstream."
3140,"The level of official apathy can be gauged from the fact that during the last year of its tenure, the Rao Government allocated Rs 42 crore for the welfare of the disabled, which works out to Rs 8 per person."
3141,"The BJP believes that those who have been excluded from playing a participatory role in the nation-building process by being stigmatised as ‘disabled’, should be empowered so that they become productive, proud citizens of our country."

3144,The BJP is committed to further strengthen this achievement.
3145,This is in stark contrast to the insecurity faced by minority communities under Congress rule.
3146,We have been steadfastly opposed to appeasement as state policy since it benefits only those sections which profess regressive and retrograde social norms in the guise of protecting their religious beliefs.
3147,"The BJP will be guided by its policy of ‘justice for all, appeasement of none’."
3148,"A resurgent India will enter the 21st century with the resolve of one nation, one people and one culture."

3159,"The Bharatiya Janata Party has mobilised its own resources, men and material to provide succour to these unfortunate victims of government apathy and terrorist violence."
3160,But a lot more needs to be done.
3161,"Similarly, thousands of Buddhist Chakmas have fled the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh in the face of persecution by Muslim settlers from the plains and the Bangladesh Rifles."
3162,Most of them are at present living in camps in Tripura.
3163,"Regardless of the grim future that awaits them back home, the Government of India has shown unnecessary haste in trying to repatriate them—an action that is largely motivated by the petty politics of the Congress."

3202,The distinctive feature of our State Governments is their singular achievement in curbing communal and caste conflict.
3203,This is in stark contrast to the situation that prevails in States ruled by the Congress or the Janata Dal where the law and order machinery has virtually collapsed.
3204,A shining example of our achievement on this front is the communal peace that prevails in Maharashtra which till recently was wrecked by riots and social conflict.

3406,The nation is on the verge of bankruptcy and has been reduced to begging for hand-outs from all and sundry.
3407,Indian ambassadors go   328 • Party Document Vol-1 abroad to beg for loans and even the Prime Minister has to genuflect before heads of foreign nations.
3408,As a result India’s international rating has sunk to a new low.
3409,"India is one of the few countries in the world without a proper government, without a proper budget and without a proper economic policy."
3410,"The net result is an upside-down economy in which farmers who produce cotton cannot afford to buy cloth; and masons who put up five-star hotels, have no roofs over their heads."

3424,"When he prospers, India prospers."
3425,"We have waived the loam of poor agriculturists in Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan."
3426,But the Kisan will continue to flounder in poverty unless the burden of the people depending on agriculture is reduced.
3427,A countrywide network of agro-industrial complexes in rural areas should relieve the burden and provide the real answer to the problem of poverty of the peasantry.
3428,BJP aims at rural development where farmer will not be forced to borrow.

3431,Cluster of agro-centers would be promoted which would   330 • Party Document Vol-1 take up activities directly relating to agriculture and also meet other requirements of villagers.
3432,This would help to generate employment to rural youths who are not actually required in agricultural activities.
