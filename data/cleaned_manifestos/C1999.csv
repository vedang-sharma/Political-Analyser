0,"Election Manifesto for the 1999 Lok Sbha Elections Part I Barely an year and a half after the l998 general elections, the people of India are being forced to elect a new Lok Sabha."
1,The responsibility for this lies squarely with the BJP.
2,"After the last general elections, the BJP-led alliance was nowhere near commanding a majority in the Lok Sabha."
3,"Inspite of this, the BJP opportunistically formed a government under its leadership."
4,"Right through its tenure, this government was poised precariously on the brink of collapse, because the BJP had put together a rag-tag coalition which even included parties which had fought the election against it."
5,"Finally, the inevitable happened."
6,"After 13 months of mind-boggling misrule, the government made an ignominious exit."
7,Rule by the BJP at the Centre is fundamentally different than rule by any other party.
8,The BJP is a party guided by the RSS.
9,"It believes in Hindutva, and is committed to dismantling the secular–democratic values of the Indian Republic."
10,The l3-month stint of the Vajpayee government proves this conclusively.
11,"For the first time, the very basis of the secular principles enshrined in the Constitution stand threatened."
12,The values which have become part of the common consciousness of the Indian people will be eroded if the BJP continues to be in Government.
13,The thirteen-month rule of the BJP-led government has been an unmitigated disaster for the country.
14,It has • aggravated the strains on national unity; instilled fear and insecurity amongst the minorities; • • given a bonanza to foreign capital and big business; imposed heavy burdens on the common people; and • • promoted the large-scale penetration of the administration by the RSS.
15,"Contrary to the claim that the BJP-led government has adhered to the coalition's National Agenda for Governance, the actual experience shows that the RSS–BJP led combine pushed ahead with its own Hindutva agenda: • The period saw the most widespread and systematic attack on the Christian community."
16,• At no time since independence has such a virulent and violent campaign of intimidation been launched against a small minority.
17,• The gruesome murder of Graham Staines and his two children epitomises the intolerance and hatred towards religious minorities.
18,• The BJP-led government wished to pursue its agenda of reviewing the Constitution.
19,"The aim of this agenda is to eliminate all the secular provisions, like Article 370 and Article 30, which guarantees the rights of minorities."
20,• Systematic efforts were made to subvert the secular nature of higher education by appointing pro-RSS personnel.
21,• Artists and intellectuals who opposed communal ideology and divisive politics 1 were threatened and intimidated.
22,"Increasing Authoritarianism Even though the BJP ran a rickety coalition government, it did not hesitate to resort to authoritarian measures."
23,"It used the draconian Article 356—not once, but twice—to dismiss the elected Bihar state government."
24,"It is only the firm stand taken by the President and the BJP’s failure to muster a majority in the Rajya Sabha, which foiled this brazen attack on democracy."
25,The BJP leadership in government advocated a presidential form of government by doing away with the Parliamentary system.
26,It planned to get this issue taken up in the review of the Constitution.
27,It resorted to the cynical use of ordinances to bypass Parliament.
28,The ordinance to amend Prasar Bharati was promulgated after bypassing the Rajya Sabha.
29,"It arbitrarily dismissed the Naval Chief of Staff, Admiral Bhagwat."
30,"After such an act, unprecedented in the history of independent India, the government refused to discuss the matter in the Parliament."
31,The continuance of the BJP in government would mean ushering in an authoritarian system based on Hindutva.
32,"Swadeshi Agents of MNCs Soon after assuming power, the BJP abandoned whatever little pretensions of Swadeshi it claimed, and embarked on a shameless spree of wooing multinational corporations and opening up all sectors of the economy indiscriminately to foreign capital."
33,"Thanks to these policies, MNCs are taking over Indian companies and buying up the Indian partners' share in joint ventures."
34,No previous government has attacked the public sector so vigorously.
35,Privatisation is the watchword of the BJP.
36,The party is hell-bent on selling public assets at scandalously low prices to big business and foreign companies.
37,"By asking profitable public sector units to buy back their own shares from the government and cross- purchase of shares by PSUs, serious damage was done to the major PSUs."
38,"The only budget that the BJP-led government presented for 1999–2000 gave concessions worth ₹ 8,000 crores to the corporate sector and the affluent sections."
39,"2 Vicious Circle: Rising Prices By dismantling the Public Distribution System to benefit private traders, the BJP has thrown the rural and urban poor at the mercy of black marketeers, hoarders and profiteers for buying essential commodities."
40,"The onion price rise scandal and the dropsy deaths due to mustard oil adulteration in Delhi under the BJP state government, typify this anti-people policy."
41,"The Vajpayee government launched an all- round attack against the ordinary people by big increases in the issue prices of rice, wheat and sugar in the Public Distribution System."
42,"One after another, the prices of all essential items -- railway fares, postal rates, petrol, diesel, cooking gas and urea -- were all hiked up."
43,The BJP-led government has promoted the MNC exploitation of agriculture.
44,Companies like Monsanto have been given a free run to exploit Indian farmers.
45,"By refusing to firmly renegotiate provisions under the WTO and giving in to the pressures to make harmful amendments to the Patent Law, the Vajpayee government has threatened the interests of farmers; American companies are patenting neem, karela, jamun and other indigenous plants; the common people will have no access to cheap medicines."
46,"Under the Export-Import Policy, over 1300 items were allowed free imports; such large-scale import liberalisation of a wide range of agricultural and industrial goods will spell ruin for the peasantry and domestic industries."
47,"Unlike previous governments, the BJP-led government refused to even consider the adoption of a Central legislation for agricultural workers to safeguard the minimum rights of the most oppressed sections in the rural areas."
48,"The Vajpayee government's record is one of shameless and servile catering to big business, MNCs and the affluent, while ruthlessly squeezing the poor by high prices of essential commodities, failure to generate employment opportunities, and allowing the landlord–trader nexus to fleece the poor peasants."
49,Dubious Record of Corruption The Vajpayee government has ended its regime with one of the biggest corruption scandals in independent India.
50,"It has brazenly gifted away thousands of crores of rupees to the big business, Indian and foreign telecom companies."
51,"By changing the existing policy for operators in the cellular and basic telephone services to benefit a few big companies, the BJP leadership has set a new record in receiving kickbacks by depriving the government of precious revenue."
52,It removed its own Minister for Communications to accomplish this.
53,"Every authority under the Constitution to which this matter was referred—the President of India, the Election Commission and the Courts—has expressed serious reservations about it."
54,"Yet, under the leadership of the Prime Minister himself, the government has acted as the agent for big capitalists."
55,"That this is not the only scam the BJP government has perpetrated is illustrated by the revelations of the former Advisor to the Finance Minister, Mohan Guruswamy."
56,He 3 has exposed how favours to big business have been granted through unscrupulous corrupt practices at the highest levels.
57,"Major projects have been approved in the power, telecom, petroleum and other sectors which warrant a serious investigation to uncover the nexus between the MNCs, big business and the BJP government."
58,All those guilty of corrupt practices must be brought to book.
59,"Foreign Policy: Disastrous Course Within a short period, the BJP-led government has reversed the course of India's foreign policy whose foundations were based on non-alignment and independence in decision making."
60,"After the Pokhran tests, faced with international isolation, the Vajpayee government began succumbing to US pressures."
61,"In its anxiety to get acceptance as a nuclear weapon power, it conducted an eight-month long secret diplomacy through the Jaswant Singh–Strobe Talbott talks, unprecedented in India's diplomatic history."
62,The shift to a pro-imperialist policy soon became evident.
63,The Vajpayee government refused to condemn the US missile attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan.
64,It was lukewarm in its criticism of the NATO aggression on Yugoslavia.
65,It refuses to oppose the drive for US global hegemony.
66,The Vajpayee government harmed the process of improving relations with China by the Prime Minister's letter to President Clinton citing China as a security threat.
67,The Vajpayee government has isolated India in the non-aligned movement and in the international community by its shortsighted and wrong policies.
68,"Compromising National Security By conducting the nuclear tests in Pokhran, the BJP-led government abandoned India's long-standing policy of developing nuclear technology without going in for weaponisation."
69,Jingoistic positions were taken on the bomb.
70,"The Home Minister even linked India's nuclear weapon status to the resolution of the Kashmir dispute, thereby inviting the internationalisation of the Kashmir issue."
71,Pakistan retaliated with its own tests and a nuclear arms race has been launched detrimental to the interests of the peoples of the two countries.
72,"After adopting an aggressive posture, the Vajpayee government soon retreated and succumbed to US pressures."
73,It agreed to sign the CTBT.
74,This unprecedented step could not be implemented because of the fall of the Vajpayee government.
75,The United States is banking on the BJP to complete the act of betrayal of India's interests by signing the CTBT and making undisclosed commitments on the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty.
76,4 The Vajpayee government set up a National Security Council.
77,"Then it made a mockery of the NSC, with it having no role whatsoever during the Kargil conflict."
78,The BJP-led government has compromised national security by interfering in the higher echelons of the armed forces.
79,The dismissal of the Naval Chief of Staff is the most glaring illustration of this.
80,"Blinded by its own rhetoric of India becoming a big power and of security being enhanced with nuclear weapons, the Vajpayee government is directly responsible for the fiasco of not detecting the large-scale Pakistani intrusion in Kargil in time."
81,"Kargil and After Lulled into complacency by the Lahore bus trip of the Prime Minister, the Vajpayee government was caught unawares when the large-scale planned intrusion by the Pakistan armed forces was organised."
82,It is now clear that the planning began late last year and the Kargil infiltration took place around the time Prime Minister Vajpayee visited Lahore.
83,The early reports indicating the violation of the Line of Control were either ignored or not taken seriously in the anxiety to project the Lahore bus trip as a great achievement of the Prime Minister.
84,The country had to pay a heavy price for this gross negligence.
85,For over two months the Indian armed forces had to battle in difficult conditions to evict the intruders from the Indian side of the LoC.
86,The heroic fight waged by the Indian jawans and officers has resulted in India defending its territorial integrity.
87,This was achieved due to the bravery of the armed forces who worked in enormously difficult conditions in the icy heights to undo the damage caused by the unnoticed intrusion.
88,Pakistan had planned this provocation to internationalise the Kashmir issue; it invoked intervention by the US and the Western powers by highlighting that both the countries involved in the conflict possessed nuclear weapons.
89,Now Pakistan expects direct talks on Kashmir under US auspices.
90,The Vajpayee government in its over- eagerness to get American support has willy-nilly provided the US the status of a mediator or facilitator.
91,What Kargil highlights is the need to reverse the shortsighted positions taken by the Vajpayee government with regard to our security and foreign policy.
92,Forgotten Commitments The BJP had no time for fulfilling any of its elementary pledges.
93,"For instance, • What happened to the 8–9 per cent annual rate of growth of GDP?"
94,• What happened to the promise of providing one crore jobs a year (ten crores in ten years)?
95,• What happened to the 20 lakh additional housing units annually?
96,• What happened to the 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament and state legislatures?
97,5 • What happened to the Lok Pal Bill?
98,• Where are the promised electoral reforms and the National Judicial Commission?
99,The record of the Vajpayee government is one of unscrupulous politicking; opportunist compromises with miniscule parties to remain in power; industrial recession and economic stagnation; generous handouts to Indian and foreign big business; relentless price-rise and growing unemployment; authoritarianism and RSS penetration in organs of the state; unprecedented attacks on minorities and harmful positions on foreign policy and national security.
100,Congress is Not the Alternative The strengthening of the democratic and federal system in our country requires a vibrant multi-party democracy.
101,The CPI (M) rejects the contention that the choice for the people should be reduced to a BJP-led combination or a Congress alternative.
102,The Congress party's basic policies do not provide a democratic alternative to the BJP.
103,"It still advocates economic policies initiated in 1991, which are against the interests of the toiling people of the country."
104,The Congress party is bereft of the political and ideological will to rally all the secular and democratic forces to fight the menace of communalism.
105,"It has not shown any determination to stamp out corruption, which marked its earlier period of rule."
106,"On questions of economic policies, the BJP and the Congress have no basic differences."
107,"Whether it be privatisation and further liberalisation, opening up of insurance or the patents bill, the Congress does not offer any alternative to the disastrous performance of the BJP-led government."
108,It is only the CPI (M) and the Left forces which have a consistent record in opposing the pro-big business-MNC policies and fighting for alternative policies.
109,"Strengthen the CPI(M) and Left To strengthen the Left forces who are the firmest defenders of secularism and the interests of the working people, it is necessary that the CPI (M) and the Left succeed in registering big victories in West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura where the main contest is between the Left-led forces and the Congress/Trinamul Congress."
110,"For the future of secular democracy, national unity and to advance the struggle for social and economic justice, it is essential that the CPI (M) and the Left parties come back with increased strength in the Lok Sabha."
111,"It is the effective intervention of the Left, which will enable all the democratic and secular forces to work for an effective third alternative."
112,Record of the Left 6 The Left parties have a consistent record of not compromising with communalism in any form.
113,The Left parties stand for uniting all sections of the people in order to advance the struggle to bring in alternative policies opposed to liberalisation and communalism.
114,"The record of the Left-led governments of West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura is a testimony to the progressive alternative that can be put in place if the Left and democratic forces are strengthened at the national level."
115,"Implementing land reforms, ensuring democratic functioning of the three-tier panchayat system, empowering the people with more democratic rights, defending secularism, maintaining communal amity and expanding the rights of the working people—these are all the gains made in the three Left-ruled states."
116,These elections will put in place a government which will provide the direction for India on the threshold of the 21st century.
117,"The choice is clear: We have to decide whether we wish to strengthen India as a secular republic, a republic in which all citizens are treated equally in every sense, or whether we wish to plunge India into an abyss where sectarian religious hatred and discord becomes the norm."
118,• Defeat the BJP and its Allies.
119,• Strengthen the CPI(M) and Left.
120,"• Support the Left, democratic and secular forces for a secular government."
121,"Part - II More than fifty years after independence, the policies pursued by successive governments in favour of the big capitalists and landlords have resulted in the all- round failure to solve the basic problems of the people."
122,"Despite the advances made due to the collective efforts of all sections of the people, growing disparities, hunger, unemployment, illiteracy and disease are the lot of millions of Indians."
123,It is only the CPI(M) and the Left parties which address the basic issue of presenting alternative policies -- policies which can end social and economic inequalities.
124,"As India enters the 21st century, the struggle for a more democratic society, economic and social justice for all citizens and the strengthening of national unity requires a comprehensive alternative platform of policies."
125,This will constitute the basis for a third alternative.
126,"In the present elections, the CPI(M) wishes to advance the struggle for such a set of policies."
127,Strengthen Secular Foundations The CPI (M) advocates: • Legislation for separation of religion and politics in light of the Supreme Court judgement in the Bommai Case; • Effective prohibition on the use of religions issues for electoral purposes; • Implementation of the Protection of Places of Worship Act to see that no disputes on religious places arise; 7 • The Ayodhya dispute to be referred to Supreme Court under Article 138(2) for a speedy judicial verdict; • Special steps to prosecute all those found guilty by the Sri Krishna Commission for the Mumbai riots of 1993.
128,"Federalism for National Unity The CPI (M) will work for: • Greater powers to the states in the economic and political spheres; • Constitutional amendments for devolving more powers in the economic, fiscal and administrative areas; decentralisation of powers to the district bodies and panchayats; ensuring local participation in formulation of plans and projects; • The federal system has to be institutionalised by activising the Inter-State Council and empowering the National Development Council with sufficient powers; • Priority for replacing Article 356 with a suitable provision so that the draconian power of the Centre to dismiss state governments is curbed; this power to be exercised only in extreme contingencies where there is a direct threat to national unity or an onslaught on the secular basis of the State; • Maximum autonomy for the state of Jammu & Kashmir by revising Article 370 of the Constitution; regional autonomy to be provided to Jammu and Ladakh regions within the state framework; • Negotiations to be conducted with all those groups in the North-East who are advocating separatism while firmly defending the integrity of the Indian Union; • Special provision for the development of the North-Eastern region with particular emphasis on infrastructure and development of employment opportunities."
129,Foreign Policy It is essential to reverse the harmful foreign policy positions of the Vajpayee government.
130,"The CPI (M) will work for: • A foreign policy which is independent, non-aligned and defends India from imperialist pressures; initiative to revive non-aligned movement; • An active foreign policy which opposes US superpower hegemony and NATO's new global intervention; and active solidarity with countries which are subject to US and NATO aggression like Iraq, Yugoslavia, Cuba; • Democratising the Security Council and United Nations structure; • According special attention to resume dialogue with China to improve relations; for closer ties with Russia and special efforts to coordinate and foster relations between India, Russia and China; • A resumption of dialogue with Pakistan on clear understanding that there will be no third party role; Emphasis on people-to-people relations between the two countries and maintain cultural and trade relations to create a proper atmosphere for defusing tensions and improving overall relations."
131,• Acceleration of steps to improve relations with neighbours and promote SAARC cooperation.
132,8 National Security The CPI (M) stands for: • Halting nuclear weaponisation; revert to nuclear policy of developing India's independent technological potential while not signing any international treaty which is discriminatory.

136,• Removal of nuclear weapons from the US military base in Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
137,• Create a national security apparatus which will work within the framework of the parliamentary democratic system.
138,Economic Policies: For Equitable Growth and Self-Reliance The policies of liberalisation since 1991 have benefited the affluent 10 per cent of the upper strata while subjecting the rest to acute deprivation.
139,The BJP-led government has pushed ahead with this disastrous policy which suits the interests of the IMF– World Bank driven globalisation and in the interests of the imperialist countries.
140,"As against this, the CPI (M) sets out a comprehensive platform of economic policies."
141,"Land Reforms • The Central government has to give a new thrust for speedy and comprehensive steps for implementing land reforms; • Stop dilution of land ceiling laws to favour big business and foreign companies; plug loopholes in existing legislation; • Take over and distribution of surplus land above the ceiling, handing over cultivable waste land to the landless, correction of land records, security for tenants and issuance of joint pattas for women."
142,Develop Agriculture • Prohibit sale of agricultural lands to foreign companies or their subsidiaries for agri-business.

157,"• Ending the deployment of deep-sea fishing trawlers, protecting rights of the fishing community."
158,"WTO • During review of WTO Agreement in 1999, India should insist on critical review of the agreements made in the Uruguay Round; safeguard India's position with regard to TRIPS and oppose any multilateral agreement on investments; work for removal of WTO incompatible national legislations like Section 301 of US Trade Act."
159,Financial Sector The insurance sector should remain in the public sector; LIC and GIC should be streamlined for greater efficiency; foreign companies should be barred entry into this sector; the trend of privatising the banking sector should be halted; reforms should be introduced to make banks accountable and restore social priorities; there should be proper regulation of non-banking finance companies to safeguard interests of depositors; capital flows should be regulated; no convertibility should be allowed on the capital account.
160,"Resource Mobilisation • Broaden the direct taxes base; instead of reducing taxes on the rich, raise the tax rates on the affluent sections (corporate tax, wealth tax, income tax, etc.)"
161,and ensure strict compliance; tax evasion should be firmly dealt with.
162,• Unearth black money kept inside and outside the country and tap it for 10 productive purposes.
163,• Wasteful expenditure and the growing misuse of public money by officialdom and public servants should be stopped.

165,"In a poverty-stricken country like India, it is the states' responsibility to provide minimum food supply to eliminate hunger and malnutrition."
166,"For this, the CPI (M) demands that: • 14 essential commodities should be included for supply in the PDS."
167,• A network of fair-price shops and cooperatives should cover all panchayats.
168,"• Overhead costs should be curtailed, wastage and leakage from the FCI and distribution mechanism should be eliminated."

170,Working Class The BJP-led government's policies intensified the industrial crisis leading to the closure of thousands of industrial units and loss of employment for lakhs of workers.
171,"The onslaught on the public sector, the decision to close down eight public sector units and the failure to revive potentially viable units have led to a crisis of employment."
172,"Side by side, undermining existing laws by allowing employers to violate labour laws have increased the exploitation of the workers."
173,"The CPI (M) will fight for: • Revival of sick units, ending of disinvestment in public sector units, revival of sick public sector units by a suitable package of measures including reorienting the government policy on tax-concession, order-placement, credit, etc."
174,"in that direction; the revival of NTC mills, fertiliser units, IISCO, IDPL, etc."

176,Workers' dues must get the priority over all other items while settling liabilities of any company/industrial units.

196,• Free and universal education to be guaranteed for all children upto the age of 14 years.
