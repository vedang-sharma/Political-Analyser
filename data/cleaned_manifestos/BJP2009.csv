0,"TO BUILD A PROSPEROUS, POWERFUL NATION, RECALL INDIA’S PAST Indian civilisation is perhaps the most ancient and continuing civilisation of the world."
1,India has a long history and has been recognised by others as a land of great wealth and even greater wisdom.
2,But India has also experienced continued foreign attacks and alien rule for centuries and this has resulted in a loss of pride in India and its remarkable achievements.
3,"Indians, particularly educated under the system of education imposed by the Britishers, have lost sight of not only the cultural and civilisational greatness of India, but also of its technological achievements and abounding natural resources."
4,History tells us that India was a land of abundance.
5,"The country has been blessed with great natural fertility, abundant water and unlimited sunshine."
6,"According to foreigners visiting this country, Indians were regarded as the best agriculturists in the world."
7,Records of these travels from the 4th Century BC till early- 19th Century speak volumes about our agricultural abundance which dazzled the world.
8,The Thanjaur (900-1200 AD) inscriptions and Ramnathapuram (1325 AD) inscriptions record 15 to 20 tonnes per hectare production of paddy.
9,"Now, even after the first green revolution, according to Government statistics, Ludhiana in the late-20th Century recorded a production of 5.5 tonnes of paddy per hectare."
10,"It is, therefore, imperative that India rediscovers an agricultural technology which incorporates all the inputs from our own wisdom and agricultural skills that made us a land of abundance in food."
11,Indian economy was as flourishing as its agriculture.
12,Foreigners from Magasthenes to Fa-Hian and Hiuen-Tsiang have described and praised Indian material prosperity.
13,Indian villages around 1780 in Bihar have been cited as an example of cleanliness and hospitality.
14,The streets were swept and watered and the people had a remarkable sense of hospitality and attention to accommodate the needs of the travellers.
15,Old British documents established that India was far advanced in the technical and educational fields than Britain of 18th and early-19th Century.
16,Its agriculture technically and productively was far superior; it produced a much higher grade of 2 BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 iron and steel.
17,"The Iron Pillar at Mehrauli in Delhi has withstood the ravages of time for 1,500 years or more without any sign of rusting or decay."
18,Metallurgists of the world have marvelled at this high degree of sophistication in technology.
19,Textiles formed the great industrial enterprise of pre-British India.
20,"Up to the late-18th Century, India was the leading producer and exporter of textiles; China was then a close second."
21,"Indian advancements in astronomy, mathematics, chemistry, physics and biological sciences have been documented and recognised all over the world."
22,Contributions in the field of medicine and surgery are also well known.
23,Ayurveda and Yoga are the best gifts from India to the world in creating a healthy civilisation.
24,"India knew plastic surgery, practised it for centuries and, in fact, it has become the basis of modern plastic surgery."
25,India also practised the system of inoculation against small pox centuries before the vaccination was discovered by Dr Edward Jenner.
26,"Fa-Hian, writing about Magadha in 400 AD, has mentioned that a well organised health care system existed in India."
27,"According to him, the nobles and householders of this country had founded hospitals within the city to which the poor of all countries, the destitute, the crippled and the diseased may repair."
28,“They receive every kind of requisite help.
29,"Physicians inspect their diseases, and according to their cases, order them food and drink, medicines or decoctions, everything in fact that contributes to their ease."
30,"When cured they depart at their ease.” It has been established beyond doubt by the several reports on education at the end of the 18th Century and the writings of Indian scholars that not only did India have a functioning indigenous educational system but that it actually compared more than favourably with the system obtaining in England at the time in respect of the number of schools and colleges proportionate to the population, the number of students in schools and colleges, the diligence as well as the intelligence of the students, the quality of the teachers and the financial support provided from private and public sources."
31,"Contrary to the then prevailing opinion, those attending school and college included an impressive percentage of lower caste students, Muslims and girls."
32,"Mahatma Gandhi was absolutely right in saying that India was more illiterate in 1931 compared to its state of literacy 50-60 years ago, i.e."
33,in 1870.
34,"India had also an expertise in ship building, as also in extensive manufacturing and uses of dyes, and also in manufacturing paper."
35,"India had a share of about 22.5 per cent of world GDP in 1600 AD which during British domination suffered a steep decline to 12.25 per cent in 1870, while the British share in the same period rose sharply from 1.8 per cent to 9.1 per cent."
36,"When Britishers left India, the economy was completely shattered and India’s share in world manufacture, trade and GDP declined further."
37,"Even after 62 years of Independence, BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 3 India’s share in world market remains less than one per cent."
38,"India’s prosperity, its talents and the state of its high moral society can be best understood by what Thomas Babington Macaulay stated in his speech of February 02, 1835, in the British Parliament."
39,"“I have travelled across the length and breadth of India and I have not seen one person who is a beggar, who is a thief, such wealth I have seen in this country, such high moral values, people of such high caliber, that I do not think we would ever conquer this country, unless we break the very back bone of this nation, which is her spiritual and cultural heritage, and therefore, I propose that we replace her old and ancient education system, her culture, for if the Indians think that all that is foreign and English is good and greater than their own, they will lose their self esteem, their native culture and they will become what we want them, a truly dominated nation.” This policy was implemented very meticulously by Britishers and the education system was created to make Indian’s ignorant about themselves."
40,"No nation can chart out its domestic or foreign policies unless it has a clear understanding about itself, its history, its strength and failings."
41,It becomes all the more important for any nation to know its roots which sustain its people in a highly mobile and globalised world.
42,"Leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Sri Aurobindo, Mahatma Gandhi and others who spearheaded the freedom movement had built the struggle around a clear vision of India’s civilisational consciousness."
43,Indian ways of thought and action were in the centre of their political action.
44,"These leaders had a vision to reconstruct the political and economic institutions of India as a continuum of the civilisational consciousness which made India one country, one people and one nation."
45,It is unfortunate that the leaders of independent India quickly discarded this vision and continued to work with the institutional structures created by the British which had nothing to do with India’s world view and its vitality which were responsible for its survival despite continued outside attacks and alien rule.
46,"During the six decades of our independence, governance of our country, except for a short period, was with the Congress and its associates."
47,It was most unfortunate that they never thought of creating a socio-economic and political paradigm of governance drawing from the civilisational consciousness of India.
48,"They, instead, tried to emulate whatever was being practised in this or that Western country."
49,The disastrous results are before us.
50,What was required after independence was to reorient India’s polity to bring it in consonance with the seekings and sensibilities of the Indian people.
51,"Failure to do so has resulted in a fractured society, vast economic disparities, terrorism and communal conflict, insecurity, moral, psychological and spiritual degradation, and a state 4 BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 apparatus unable to handle any of these problems."
52,Attempts are sometimes made to apply palliatives to manage the affairs but nothing succeeds.
53,"What is needed is to arrive at a consensus about the ‘Idea’ of India and also about the seekings and preferences of the people and how they find expression in various socio-economic, political organisations and cultural, aesthetic and ethical sensibilities of the people of India."
54,The civilisational consciousness of India has been well defined by the sages and philosophers and has its roots in Bharatiya or Hindu world view.
55,This world view is holistic and spiritual.
56,It accepts that diversity is inherent in the scheme of creation; it is the manifestation of the same cosmic entity in different forms.
57,Hence it not only accepts diversity but respects it and even more celebrates it.
58,Hindu or Bharatiya view of life seeks unity in diversity.
59,It is an inclusive approach and one can say that Hinduism is the most ennobling experience in spiritual co-existence.
60,The Bharatiya mind has contemplated beyond national boundaries and the Vedic Rishi declared in the hoary past ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbukam’ – that the world is a family.
61,"The horizons of India’s worldview are known to have extended from Bamiyan / Kandahar to Borobudur / Indonesia on the one hand, and Sri Lanka to Japan on the other."
62,Imprints of Indian culture are found in some other parts of the world as well.
63,"In ancient times India was isolated in geography but not in cultural relationship, trade and commerce."
64,The belief in essential unity of mankind is a unique feature of Hindu thought.
65,The Vedic Rishi had also declared that ‘Ekam Sad Viprah Bahudha Vadanti’ (truth or reality is one but wise men describe it in different ways).
66,This is essentially a secular thought in the real sense of the term because it accepts that one can follow his own path to reach the ultimate.
67,Hindus are well known for their belief in harmony of religions.
68,And because of this world view almost all religions practised in different parts of the world have existed peacefully in India and will continue to do so.
69,But it appears that even after six decades of independence India has not been able to discover its innate vitality and its sense of time and consequently has lost its direction and will to act.
70,The drift is acute and has encompassed all aspects of national life.
71,"The situation needs a change and a new paradigm is called for, for creating a prosperous, progressive and powerful India whose voice is heard in international fora."
72,India can achieve this goal provided the people seriously set to this task.
73,We are endowed with vast human and material resources.
74,Indian youth have demonstrated their capabilities in various walks of life and proved their competence.
75,"In science and technology, space and atomic energy, despite handicaps and lack of BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 5 world class facilities, they have done remarkably well."
76,"In industry, business and management and information communication technology, they have successfully taken challenging risks."
77,"With this energetic and vibrant youth power and by prudently harnessing natural resources, Indians can perform miracles provided they work with self-confidence and pride in India."
78,We have to assure a prominent role and full opportunities to our youth in the decision-making process.
79,They are the future and the propellers of our prosperity.
80,India need not blindly copy this or that model of development; it should evolve a model suited to its genius and resources.
81,The Integral Humanism suggested by Pt.
82,Deen Dayal Upadhyay provides such a model.
83,"India should be original, India should innovate, and India should move upwards on the ladder of global leadership."
84,"The global scenario demands a solution, a radical solution to save the world from the impending disaster of the Great Economic Recession and terrorism looming large all over the world."
85,"India is destined to play its historic role at this crucial juncture and for this the BJP is committed to work for creating a modern, powerful, prosperous, progressive and secure India."
86,"Dr Murli Manohar Joshi Chairman Manifesto Committee April 3, 2009."
87,6 BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 FOR STABILITY & SECURITY INDIA NEEDS A DECISIVE LEADER A quirk of fate brought the Congress to power at the Centre in the summer of 2004.
88,"The United Progressive Alliance that it put together, which was able to secure parliamentary majority with the help of the Left parties, has shown remarkable lack of cohesiveness with individual Ministers representing the Congress’ allies running their allotted Ministries like their personal fiefdom."
89,This was a Government totally divorced from the twin principles of collective responsibility and accountability.
90,"The nation was thus burdened with a Prime Minister who was in office but not in power; and, a Government that was in power but not in authority."
91,This was supposed to be a Government that would work for the welfare of the ‘aam admi’ – the common man.
92,"As it prepares to exit office after five years, the Government has nothing to show by way of extending a ‘hand’ to the ‘aam admi’."
93,This Government will be remembered for four things.
94,It was headed by the weakest Prime Minister the country has ever had.
95,"Its reversal of NDA’s policies has led to a mounting sense of insecurity fuelled by repeated terrorist attacks, Maoist insurgency and separatist violence which together have claimed hundreds of innocent lives."
96,"Its gross mismanagement of the economy has caused inflation, job losses and lockouts."
97,"And, it has shielded corruption at high places by misusing agencies of the state, namely the CBI."
98,"The Congress has tried to whitewash its terrible record on the national security front, especially its abysmal failure to protect citizens from terrorism, by making cosmetic changes in antiquated laws."
99,This is clearly not enough.
100,"It has sought to gloss over the increasing cost of food, which is eight per cent higher than in 2008, and many times more than in 2004, by projecting misleading statistics."
101,Lakhs of people in the unorganised sector have lost their jobs over the past year.
102,Skilled workers are losing their jobs in the organised sector.
103,This is far worse than unemployment because it impoverishes families dependent on assured income and dampens the national spirit.
104,"* The worst hit are India’s youth, especially those who are looking forward to enter the job market."
105,The Congress-led UPA Government has gifted them with a bleak future.
106,"As for the poor, they feel abandoned by the Congress-led regime."
107,The much-publicised National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme has turned out to be as much a flop as all other schemes of the Government.
108,It is a telling comment on the UPA’s performance that a BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 7 whopping 55 million people have been pushed below the poverty line over the past five years.
109,"This is according to a study by the Indian Statistical Institute, based on data collated by the National Sample Survey Organisation; the real figure could be much higher."
110,"In rural India, thousands of farmers have committee suicide to escape the burden of mounting debt and grinding poverty."
111,They are victims of Government apathy.
112,An equally damning indictment of the Congress-led UPA regime is galloping urban poverty.
113,"An estimated 23.7 per cent of the population in cities and towns lives in slums, according to ‘India: Urban Poverty Report, 2009’, amid squalor, crime, disease and tension."
114,"Such glaring deprivation and denial, such rising numbers of people below the poverty line, contradict this nation’s aspirations."
115,They are obstacles to India’s emergence as a great power and need to be removed through remedial Government intervention.
116,The stability of the NDA years helped India to prosper.
117,The drift of the UPA years has put India in reverse gear.
118,The BJP will restore the stability which India desperately needs.
119,"* The BJP, immediately upon coming to power, will address the key issues of security and economy."
120,"It will resume the employment-generating, prosperity-creating policies of the NDA Government headed by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, through massive investments in infrastructure projects, by nursing agriculture back to health, and by making credit easily accessible to industry, while ensuring the safety and security of all people from the depredations of terrorists."
121,India today faces a severe crisis of leadership.
122,"The nation needs a determined and decisive leader who has the capacity, commitment and conviction to take command of the situation and lead from the front."
123,The country needs a leader who can restore Government’s credibility and the people’s confidence in themselves.
124,"The polity needs a leader who values consensus over conflict, consultation over confrontation."
125,Then alone can good governance replace the all-round failure of the Congress.
126,That leader is Shri L.K.
127,Advani.
128,Shri Advani has an exemplary record of service to the nation covering over six decades.
129,"A leader of impeccable integrity, he was one of the chief crusaders for democracy during the Emergency (1975-77) and spent 19 months in jail."
130,"He led the Ayodhya movement, the biggest mass movement in India since Independence, and initiated a powerful debate on cultural nationalism and the true meaning of secularism."
131,"Along with Shri Vajpayee, he was the principal architect of the BJP’s triumph, as the head of the National Democratic Alliance, in forming a stable and successful non-Congress coalition Government at the Centre (1998-2004)."
132,"As India’s Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, he ably assisted Shri Vajpayee in steering the ship of the nation through difficult waters."
133,"8 BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 The BJP is proud that it is seeking the people’s mandate in the 2009 general election, along with its allies in the NDA, under the leadership of Shri Advani."
134,"* The BJP is contesting the 2009 15th Lok Sabha election on a Manifesto that commits the party to an agenda for change guided by three goals: GOOD GOVERNANCE, DEVELOPMENT and SECURITY."
135,"Our focus will be on the nation’s youth, on addressing their concerns and helping them achieve their aspirations."
136,We will lay emphasis on empowerment through excellence by providing quality education.
137,We will ensure the security of life and property.
138,"Reviving the economy, re-orienting it towards agriculture, rural development, and unorganised and informal sectors; creating adequate employment opportunities for the youth; pushing back the price line; and, investing heavily in infrastructure projects are at the top of our agenda."
139,"The BJP believes that after five years of drift and missed opportunities, the time has come for a Government that works, a Government that cares."
140,"Our primary concern will be India’s rapid, inclusive, equitable and all-embracing development and stable growth that benefits the largest number of people."
141,"We will invest in rural development; we will ensure higher agricultural productivity and guarantee an assured income to farmers; and, we will protect the livelihood of the masses while creating myriad opportunities of gainful employment."
142,"BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 9 NATIONAL SECURITY FEAR SHALL NO LONGER STALK THIS LAND The last five years have been a nightmare for the people of this country as terrorists, separatists and insurgents have led the effete UPA Government on a macabre dance of death and destruction."
143,"From the daring attack on Delhi on the eve of Diwali in 2005 to the fidayeen raid on the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, from the horrendous bombings in Hyderabad (including at Mecca Masjid), Bangalore, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Guwahati to the slaughter of worshippers at Sankat Mochan Temple in Banaras, the terrorists have struck repeatedly with impunity as the Prime Minister spent sleepless nights agonising over the plight of terror suspects and eagerly offered to reward the kith and kin of terrorists killed in action."
144,"The UPA began its tenure by dismantling the anti-terror regime put together by the BJP- led NDA Government: The Prevention of Terrorism Act was scrapped; investigations were halted; and, prosecution was slowed down."
145,"The mastermind behind the daring attack on Parliament House, Mohammed Afzal Guru, was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court after being prosecuted under POTA."
146,"But a dissolute Government headed by an irresolute Prime Minister has failed to carry out the execution, sending out a clear message to India’s enemies: They shall not be punished till such time the Congress is in power."
147,"It is, therefore, not surprising that terrorists should have repeatedly attacked our cities, leaving behind a bloody trail of death and destruction."
148,"Delhi, the nation’s capital, and Mumbai, the country’s financial capital, have been hit twice, as has been Bangalore, India’s technology capital."
149,"As if the bombings of the commuter trains were not enough, the ISI despatched fidayeen for a multiple strike on Mumbai which began on November 26, 2008, and lasted for more than 60 hours."
150,Never before has India been seen to be so helpless in the face of terror.
151,"Terrorism sponsored by Pakistani agencies is only one of the reasons behind the fear that grips the people in cities, towns and villages."
152,The life and limb of the ‘aam admi’ is equally in danger on account of Maoists who have expanded their theatre of violence to 156 districts across 13 States.
153,The inter-State coordination mechanism put in place by the NDA Government has been dismantled and State Governments have been virtually left to fend for themselves in the face of mounting Maoist hostility.
154,"In Jammu & Kashmir, separatists continue to use the services of Pakistani terrorists to promote their agenda of relentless violence."
155,"In the North-East, insurgents have remorselessly killed and maimed innocent people."
156,"The situation in Assam is particularly of concern as the ULFA, which had been all but smashed during the NDA years, has regrouped and rearmed its cadres, and unleashed a relentless wave of terror."
157,"The Congress State Government has done nothing to either prevent this violence or punish ULFA; instead, unconditional talks have been offered to the killers!"
158,10 BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 Internal security is also imperilled by unchecked illegal immigration across our eastern border.
159,The vulnerability of these illegal immigrants has been time and again exploited by the ISI and its jihadi front organisations as well as local terror cells to carry out bombings and provide logistical support to foreign terrorists.
160,The Supreme Court has described illegal immigration as an act of ‘external aggression’ while striking down the IMDT Act.
161,"But the Congress, both at the Centre and in Assam, has tried to circumvent the Supreme Court’s judgement through executive orders."
162,The Gauhati High Court last year lashed out at the State Government for doing nothing to stop the illegal immigration.
163,"The High Court highlighted how a Pakistani, who had entered Assam via Bangladesh, contested Assembly elections unchallenged."
164,Vote-bank politics has not only changed the demography of vast stretches of eastern and North- East India but also eroded the authority of the state.
165,India is sitting on a tinderbox.
166,The consequences of this unabated illegal immigration are bound to be disastrous.
167,"In its dying days, the UPA Government has tried to fool the people by tampering with outdated laws and setting up a National Investigating Agency to fight terror."
168,But such half- hearted efforts to calm anger and disquiet following the 26/11 outrage are neither enough nor the right approach to tacking the menace of terrorism.
169,"The BJP will initiate the following measures within 100 days of coming to power: Revive the anti-terror mechanism that has been dismantled by the Congress; improve upon POTA to ensure it is more effective as an instrument of deterrence and a tool to prosecute offenders without innocent people being harassed; and, strengthen the operational role of the National Investigating Agency."
170,Give assent to laws drafted by State Governments for dealing with organised crime and terrorism; encourage other State Governments to adopt similar laws.
171,"Launch a massive programme to detect, detain and deport illegal immigrants."
172,"Completely revamp the internal and external intelligence agencies and review the existing system of coordination, convergence and dissemination of intelligence inputs."
173,A massive exercise will be undertaken to modernise intelligence agencies so that they are better equipped to use technology and cope with the rapidly changing trends and patterns of terrorism at home and abroad.
174,The National Security Council will be made the hub of all sector-related assessments.
175,It will be accountable for real-time intelligence dissemination; intelligence agencies will be held responsible for lapses.
176,Appointments to intelligence agencies will be on merit and not because of political patronage as has been the system during the Congress years.
177,"A Digital Security Agency will be set up to deal with cyber warfare, cyber counter- terrorism, and cyber security of national digital assets."
178,State Governments will be provided with all assistance to modernise their respective BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 11 police forces and equip them with the latest weaponry and communications technology.
179,This will be done on a mission mode approach.
180,The police are the first responders to any crisis situation.
181,"Drawing lessons from experience, police forces will be trained and fully equipped to deal with situations similar to that of Mumbai and in meeting the challenge posed by Maoists and insurgents."
182,Border management will be reviewed and improved.
183,Punitive measures will be introduced to block illegal immigration.
184,9.
185,India’s vast coastline is virtually unprotected.
186,Coastal security will be strengthened for better patrolling of Indian waters and preventing terrorists from taking the sea route to enter India.
187,A National Maritime Authority will be set up to coordinate coastal security.
188,Special courts will be set up for speedy prosecution of those involved with acts of terrorism.
189,Their trial shall be fair and justice will be done to the victims swiftly.
190,"Coercive measures, including diplomacy, will be used to deal with countries which promote cross-border terrorism."
191,"India will engage with the world in the global war on terror while not compromising on its domestic interests, primarily protecting citizens from the ravages of terrorism."
192,"The Centre will facilitate better inter-State coordination and real-time intelligence-sharing, apart from helping States to raise anti-insurgency forces, to face the threat posed by Maoists."
193,The ‘Chhattisgarh Model’ will be used for counter-Maoist operations.
194,"At the same time, every effort will be made to address the social and economic issues that make the ground fertile for Left-wing extremism."
195,Any talks with insurgent groups will be conditional and within the framework of the Constitution.
196,"The BJP will send out a simple message, loud and clear, to terrorists and their sponsors: They will have to pay a heavy price for each innocent life lost."
197,Retribution will be swift and exemplary.
198,"The authority of the state, which has been diminished by the Congress in pursuit of vote-bank politics, shall be restored."
199,"National Identity Cards for All The BJP will launch an innovative programme to establish a countrywide system of multipurpose national identity cards so as to ensure national security, correct welfare delivery, accurate tax collection, financial inclusion and voter registration."
200,"Voter identity cards, PAN cards, passports, ration cards and BPL cards are already in use though not all with photo identity."
201,The NDA proposes to make it incumbent for every Indian to have a National Identity Card.
202,The programme will be completed in three years.
203,The National Identity Card will contain enough memory and processing capabilities to 12 BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 run multiple applications.
204,Through it the NDA will ensure efficient welfare delivery and tax collection.
205,The card will also be linked to a bank account.
206,"All welfare payments, including widow and old age pensions, through the wide range of schemes such as Mother and Child support/ Kisan Credit, Students Assistance and Micro-Credit will be channelised through the National Identity Card."
207,"The card will make it possible for individuals to save and borrow money; for farmers to get bank credit, also establish accurate land titles data."
208,"The National Identity Card will also strengthen national security by ensuring accurate citizen identity, thus tracking illegal immigration."
209,"All financial transactions, purchase of property and access to public services will be possible only on the basis of the National Identity Card which will be made forgery and hacking resistant."
210,ENGAGING THE WORLD INDIA’S VOICE SHALL BE HEARD The BJP believes a resurgent India must get its rightful place in the comity of nations and international institutions.
211,The BJP also believes in a multi-polar world with no nation having overriding powers over others.
212,"Towards this end, the BJP in power will engage in meaningful diplomacy with nations across the world on equal terms."
213,The BJP’s foreign policy will be based on the principle of enlightened self-interest.
214,The BJP desires good relations between India and the USA and will strengthen the India- US strategic partnership on the principle of equality.
215,But we will not compromise on either India’s national interest or relations with another friendly country.
216,The BJP will restore the balance that has been disturbed by the UPA Government.
217,India’s traditional relations with Russia and the Central Asian Republics will be refashioned to keep pace with current realities and derive maximum mutual advantage.

220,"The dialogue process of solving the outstanding border dispute with China, which was initiated by the NDA Government under Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s leadership, will be revived."
221,We believe that both India and China can prosper and rise together; increased economic cooperation can contribute to this.
222,BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 13 India has a special role to play in the Indian Ocean region and we will pursue this vigorously.
223,The BJP believes in forging enduring friendly and cooperative relations with India’s neighbours.
224,"We also believe that political stability, progress and peace in India’s neighbourhood are essential for South Asia’s growth and development: SAARC is a good platform to promote these goals."
225,But the BJP will be guided solely by national interest while dealing with India’s neighbours.
226,"Towards this end, its decisions and actions in power will be determined by the following: Pakistan: There can be no ‘comprehensive dialogue’ for peace unless Pakistan a) dismantles the terrorist infrastructure on territory under its control; b) actively engages in prosecuting terror elements and organisations; c) puts a permanent, verifiable end to its practice of using cross-border terrorism as an instrument of state policy; d) stops using the territory of third countries to launch terror attacks on India; and, e) hands over to India individuals wanted for committing crimes on Indian soil."
227,Nepal: The BJP will re-craft India’s Nepal policy to rid it of the UPA’s biases that have influenced India’s response to events in Nepal with which our country shares a common civilisational and cultural history.
228,"India-Nepal relations must be based on friendship, mutual cooperation and harmony of interests."
229,"Towards this end, existing arrangements will be reviewed and revised bearing in mind mutual interests and benefits on the basis of dialogue."

235,"At the same time, the political, economic and human rights of Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority community must be protected by the Government in Colombo."
236,The BJP will pursue a robust relationship with Sri Lanka and regain the initiative that has been lost during the last five years.

241,"During the NDA years, special efforts were made to revive and revitalise the ties between Pravasi Bharatiyas and their ancestral land by institutionalising the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, honouring achievers and introducing the PIO card."
242,Those efforts will be given a further boost.
243,"DEFENDING INDIA NO COMPROMISE, NO CONCESSION The Indian Army, Air Force and Navy need to be strengthened in view of rapidly changing regional and global realities."

250,Our forces are performing a service to the nation and deserve better pay and privileges.

267,The Congress has fooled the people of India by selling the over-hyped India-US Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement as an absolute necessity and how it will help light up people’s homes.
268,It has done so by suppressing two crucial facts.
269,"First, as the CAG has pointed out, the UPA Government did not make the smallest effort to tap India’s own nuclear fuel supplies."
270,"Had it done so, our reactors would have produced many times more power than at present."
271,"Second, nuclear power is tremendously expensive and not affordable for the ‘aam admi’."
272,"The India-US nuclear deal, in the final analysis, is not about empowering India but disempowering India by making us dependent on American supplies and tying us to discriminatory regimes from which Pakistan is free."
273,The BJP will honour India’s commitments to prevent proliferation.

278,FOOD SECURITY WE WILL MAKE INDIA HUNGER-FREE The BJP views food security as integral to national security.
279,The spectre of a looming food crisis haunts the developing world as never before.
280,"With the agriculture sector suffering on account of the Congress’ gross negligence, India faces a real threat of food scarcity."
281,"With India becoming a net importer of food under Congress rule, there is genuine concern about food security."
282,Three factors have contributed to increasing food scarcity and the resultant sense of growing insecurity among the masses.
283,"First, the real income of workers and farmers has not kept pace with the rising cost of food, thus reducing their purchasing power."
284,"Second, the public distribution system has been severely crippled by the Congress-led Government which has been more interested in importing food grains and selling them at a high price than in securing the needs of the people."
285,"Third, with an additional 55 million people pushed below the poverty line over the last five years, there is widespread malnourishment."
286,"The economic recession has only worsened the situation and made it grimmer, especially for workers in the unorganised sector."

296,ENERGY SECURITY WE WILL PROTECT INDIA FROM FUTURE CRISES India cannot afford to lose any more time on securing its energy requirements.
297,"The Congress’s response to this issue has been episodic at best, often resulting in India failing to secure its energy interests even as other countries in the neighbourhood, most notably China, have spared no effort to single-mindedly pursue the goal of securing their energy needs for the present and future."
298,"At present India is largely dependent on imported oil and gas to meet its energy demands, especially demand for power although our per capita power consumption is only a sixth of the world average."
299,"Sixty-seven per cent of our power supply comes from fossil fuels, of which 70 per cent is imported."
