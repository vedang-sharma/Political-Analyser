1,"India has been credited to have developed, apart from philosophy and mathematics, science and technology of a very high order, which had attracted scholars from all over the world."
2,"Al-Andalusi, a Spanish scholar in the 11th Century, in his monumental work 'Tabaqat al- Umam' had discussed the state of science in different countries."
3,"He writes, ""The first nation to have cultivated science is Indiaâ€¦ India is known for wisdom of its people."
4,"Over many centuries all the kings of the past have recognized the ability of Indians in all branches of knowledge."""
5,"Andalusi further states, ""Indians, as known to all nations for many centuries, are the metal (essence) of wisdom, the source of fairness and objectivity."
6,"They are the people of sublime pensiveness, universal apologues, and useful and rare inventions."""
7,India's contribution to the march of civilization goes back to several thousand years before the Christian era.
8,"From the Vedas to Upanishads and Gautam - the Buddha and Mahavira - the 24th Jain Tirthankara and then to Kautilya and Chandra Gupta and down up to the eighteenth century, India was respected for its flourishing economy, trade, commerce and culture."
9,"It had an international outreach from Korea to Arabia, from Bamiyan to Borobudur and beyond."
10,"Before the advent of Britishers, Indian goods were internationally recognized for their quality and craftsmanship."
11,India had a much bigger role and presence in industry and manufacturing than any nation in Europe or Asia.
12,"It had a well-developed banking system and equally renowned businessmen, along with its financiers, who were contributing to create a flourishing and progressive economy."
13,"According to Sunderland, India was also one of the greatest shipbuilding nations and consequently had an access to international markets."
14,Indian prosperity held the world in thrall.
15,It was this wealth which attracted the foreigners - from Alexander to the Britishers.
16,Historical records establish the level of progress and prosperity attained by India before the advent of the Europeans.
17,"Indian advancement in mathematics, astronomy, physics and chemistry along with the biological sciences has been well recognized."
18,"India was a land of abundance, prosperity, affluence, a land of sharing and caring living in perfect harmony and peace with the nature."
19,"From ancient times almost all religions practiced in different parts of the world, have existed peacefully in India and will continue to do so."
20,India thus provides the most ennobling experience in spiritual co-existence.
21,"BJP recognizes that no nation could chart out its domestic or foreign policies unless it has a clear understanding about itself, its history, its roots, its strengths and failings."
22,"In a highly mobile and globalized world, it is imperative for a nation to know its roots that provide sustenance to its people."
23,"\ Indian freedom struggle, which was inspired by Tilak, Gandhi, Aurobindo, Patel, Bose and others, had a clear vision of the civilizational consciousness of India."
24,"These leaders had directed the freedom movement, keeping the Indian ways and thoughts in the centre of their action."
25,"They had a vision to reconstruct the political and economic institutions of India as a continuum of civilizational consciousness, which made India one country, one people, and one Nation."
26,"After achieving independence, the leaders at the helm of affairs lost the spirit and the vision, which the freedom movement had evoked."
27,They discarded the vision and adopted the institutional framework of administration created by the Britishers which was quite alien to India's world-view.
28,"It is unfortunate that these leaders could not comprehend India's inner vitality, which was the main force responsible for India's survival despite several attacks and prolonged foreign rule and thus, failed to rekindle the spirit of India."
29,"1 Even after nearly seven decades of our independence, the country has not been able to discover its innate vitality, the sense of time and the will to act."
30,"As a result, in spite of being the oldest civilization and a young republic, we are engulfed by a multi-dimensional crisis."
31,"A crisis, which has encompassed all walks of life."
32,"The rising disparities, social and communal divide and terrorism leading to a fractured society, are worsening the situation rapidly."
33,The present crisis is the result of this confusion and disconnect from the seekings and sensibilities of the people.
34,This is worse confounded by the weak and spineless leadership of the UPA Government.
35,The tragedy is further heightened by their failure to diagnose the malady and find the remedy.
36,"Instead of creating a socio-economic and political paradigm of governance drawn from the civilizational consciousness of India, the leaders tried to follow whatever was being practiced in this or that western country."
37,"Thus, we have wasted more than half of a century."
38,"Many other countries, even with smaller size and lesser resources, have surpassed us in development parameters."
39,"Another reason for this is that the Governance in these decades was marred by lack of trust, leading to excessive controls."
40,It was also marked by lack of openness in Government and lack of people's participation.
41,This has led to concentration of power in a few hands and lack of transparency breeding corruption and nepotism on a massive scale.
42,"The so-called 'liberalization' came in 1990s, but it was half-hearted."
43,It didn't work because the rest of the eco-system remained the same.
44,"However, the beginning of the 21st century showed some light under the NDA rule."
45,India started being reckoned as an economic superpower.
46,"The six-year rule of NDA had given the Nation many firsts, building an image in the International community."
47,"However, many of the hopes, potentials and projects have not been fully realized in the subsequent years."
48,"But after 2004, UPA came into power and the situation started worsening again."
49,We missed a historic national opportunity once more.
50,UPA's biggest blow to the Indian political system is that they have taken out Genuineness from Governance; Authenticity from Administration.
51,"UPA has shown Governance of Enactment, not Action."
52,It has given an Administration of Entitlement without Delivery.
53,"We have become a polity of Promises, and not Performance."
54,"We represent an economy of deficits, a work culture of delays and an asset base of deficiency."
55,"Worse, Congress-led UPA has made India a global synonym of Corruption, Scandal and Stagnation."
56,"To make it even worse, today, we are passing through total Decision and Policy Paralysis."
57,"Sluggish economic growth, unprecedented price rise and unstable Currency are its most visible facets."
58,"The following demand urgent solutions; economy including agriculture, energy, environment including natural resources, education and health, employment, external and internal threats to security, empowerment, Governance, and erosion of moral and societal values."
59,"If India has to survive as a nation, which it has to, in order to play its destined role in the comity of nations, if it has to make its voice heard for creating a peaceful and egalitarian world order, then we must take up the challenges with urgency and determination and provide proper solutions for them."
60,"It is a pity that we have a demoralized leadership presiding over the state apparatus, which is incompetent to handle the present problems."
61,What is needed today is to arrive at a consensus about the 'Idea' of India and also to think and redesign our approach in consonance with the seekings and preferences of the Indian people.
62,The situation in the country is deteriorating rapidly.
63,Delay in resolving the crisis would be dangerous.
64,"What is needed is to take lessons from history, recognise the vitality and resilience of India, the power of its world-view and utilize its strength, which drove it to glorious heights and analyse its weaknesses, which led to this abysmal fall."
65,Pick up the thread from the point where the continuum of our civilizational 2 consciousness was lost and reorient the polity in consonance with those strong points of Indian psyche which will be the engine for our future glory.
66,"Let's keep the windows open, have a clear understanding of the global scenario and how without destroying our uniqueness we can assimilate the best of the technological advancements."
67,We can achieve this goal provided the leaders seriously set to this task.
68,What we need is a political party committed to deliver and a leadership with strong determination and political will.
69,"As Vivekananda had said, ""All power is within you."
70,You can do anything.
71,"Believe in that."""
72,"Yes, the power lies in the people of India, in the inner sanctum sanctorum of Mother India."
73,What is needed is to ignite the spark and Mother India would rise in her full glory.
74,As Sri Ma had once said that India had become the symbolic representation of all the difficulties of modern mankind but India will also be the land of its resurrection to a higher and truer life.
75,The BJP will leave no stone unturned to fulfill the dream of 1.22 billion Indians.
76,"Today, India is blessed with the rare capacity and opportunity of Democracy, Demography and Demand."
77,"If we are able to consolidate and harness them, we will be able to reach the heights which India deserves."
78,The biggest reason for a sorry state of affairs is bad intentions on the part of those who have ruled the country for sixty years.
79,And that is where we would show the first difference.
80,"For BJP, the goal of the policies and practices would be: Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat!"
81,"The path would be: Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas."
82,This is our commitment to the Nation and to the People.
83,"With this determination of the party under the charismatic leadership of Shri Narendra Modi, we enter the elections to the 16th Lok Sabha and would work whole-heartedly to give a stable, strong, visionary and progressive Government to India."
84,It is an opportunity to change our fate and of our nation.
85,"Glory to Mother India, glory to Her children."
86,"Dr. (Prof.) Murli Manohar Joshi Chairman Manifesto Committee -2014 March 26, 2014 3 Attend the Imminent Decade under the UPA - I and II can rightly be summed in one line, the 'Decade of Decay', in which India had a free fall on all fronts - be it governance, economy, diplomacy, foreign policy, border safety, etc."
87,"At the same time, corruption, scams and crime against women have reached to unacceptable levels."
88,There has been gross misuse and total denigration of government and institutions.
89,There has also been erosion of authority of the office of the Prime Minister.
90,"The Government dithered by each passing day, casting gloom and doom on the country that was once under the NDA regime called the 'Emerging Superpower'."
91,"In 2004, NDA left the Government with a near double digit growth."
92,"The Congress- led UPA could not even maintain that growth and mismanaged the country so badly, that the growth rate declined to 4.8%, resulting the country falling in a deep mess."
93,We have lost a wonderful opportunity and have pushed the country 20 years behind and rendered millions of men and women jobless.
94,Critical and urgent challenges facing the nation have been left unaddressed.
95,"Beyond impacting the immediate short-term, this is corroding the long-term potential of the nation."
96,People feel frustrated and have lost hope in the system.
97,"Things must change, and they must change now."
98,BJP will take immediate and decisive action to address these issues on a priority basis.
99,Price Rise Runaway food inflation has crippled household budgets and contributed to the overall inflationary trend under the Congress-led UPA's watch.
100,"Even worse, the food and nutritional security of millions is threatened."
101,"However, the Congress-led UPA government has remained insensitive and indifferent to the plight of the people; tying itself into knots with short-term, mis-directed steps."
102,"The committee of Chief Ministers, headed by Shri Narendra Modi, has already submitted a report on food inflation in 2011."
103,The report was unfortunately not acted upon by the Congress-led UPA Government.
104,The BJP-led NDA Government's record of holding the prices is a demonstration of our commitment to break the vicious cycle of high inflation and high interest rates.
105,"Our immediate task will be to rein in inflation by several steps, such as: (cid:1) put in place strict measures and special Courts to stop hoarding and black marketing."
106,setting up a Price Stabilisation Fund.
107,"(cid:1) (cid:1) unbundle FCI operations into procurement, storage and distribution for greater efficiency."
108,"(cid:1) leverage on technology to disseminate Real time data, especially to farmers - on production, prices, imports, stocks and overall availability."
109,evolve a single 'National Agriculture Market'.
110,promote and support area specific crops and vegetables linked to food habits of the people.
111,Employment and Entrepreneurship The country has been dragged through 10 years of Jobless Growth by the Congress-led UPA Government.
112,"Under the broader economic revival, BJP will accord high priority to job creation and opportunities for entrepreneurship."
113,We will: (cid:1) strategically develop high impact domains like Labour-intensive manufacturing (viz.
114,"textile, footwear, electronics assembly, etc.)"
115,and Tourism.
116,"strengthen the traditional employment bases of agriculture and allied industries, and retail - through modernization as well as stronger credit and market linkages."
117,"(cid:1) 4 (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) harness the opportunities provided by the upgradation of infrastructure and housing, for its job generating potential."
118,encourage and empower our youth for self-employment - incubating entrepreneurship as well as facilitating credit.
119,address the employability issue by initiating a multi-skills development programme in mission mode.
120,"Focus will be on job creation and entrepreneurship, in both rural and urban areas."
121,transform our Employment Exchanges into Career Centres - connecting our youth with job opportunities in a transparent and effective manner through the use of technology; as well as providing counselling and training.
122,Corruption Corruption is a manifestation of poor Governance.
123,"Moreover, it reflects the bad intentions of those sitting in power."
124,All pervasive corruption under the Congress-led UPA has become a 'National Crisis'.
125,"We will establish a system, which eliminates the scope for corruption."
126,We will do this through: (cid:1) public awareness (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) technology enabled e-Governance - minimizing the discretion in the citizen-government interface.
127,"system-based, policy-driven governance - making it transparent."
128,rationalization and simplification of the tax regime - which is currently repulsive for honest tax payers.
129,"simplification of the processes and procedures at all levels - bestowing faith in the citizens, institutions and establishments."
130,"Black Money By minimizing the scope for corruption, we will ensure minimization of the generation of black money."
131,BJP is committed to initiate the process of tracking down and bringing back black money stashed in foreign banks and offshore accounts.
132,We will set up a Task Force for this purpose and to recommend amendments to existing laws or enact new laws.
133,"The process of bringing back black money to India what belongs to India, will be put in motion on priority."
134,We will also proactively engage with foreign Governments to facilitate information sharing on black money.
135,Decision and Policy Paralysis The country has suffered a decade of maladministration and scams in addition to decision and policy paralysis; thus bringing growth and development to a grinding halt leading to a 'Governance deficit'.
136,This situation will be changed and the engine of Government will be ignited again with strong willpower and commitment to public interest.
137,We will also encourage the bureaucracy to take right decisions and contribute their might in building a modern India.
138,"Poor Delivery Wherever we go, we encounter bottlenecks."
139,"We experience it on a daily basis - in government offices for even the simplest of public services, in our courts buried in high pendency and so on."
140,"Similarly, we are known by a culture of missing links and lack of last mile connectivity."
141,We have water but no pipeline to carry it; we have schools but no teachers; we have computers and machines but no electricity; we have scientists but no labs; we have instruments but no one to work on them.
142,"This 5 reduces the pace of our performance and results into wastage of time, money and energy."
143,"Intent to do the right thing and the will to do things rightly, is missing."
144,This has to be attended to on a priority basis.
145,"Whatever we do and provide for, the whole chain has to be kept in mind."
146,"With this in mind, we will: (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) remove bottlenecks and missing links in all sectors, activities and services."
147,focus on proper planning and execution for right outcomes.
148,strive for scale and speed with futuristic vision.
149,(cid:1) Build institutions for today and tomorrow.
150,"Credibility Crisis The biggest challenge that India faces today is to restore the credibility of, and trust in the Union Government."
151,"In recent years, the Union Government has lost every semblance of credibility."
152,"Its intentions, integrity and initiatives, all are questionable."
153,"The Congress party has not only lowered the dignity of the Government, but also the dignity of India."
154,This is what is driving recent adversities like the falling rupee and countries riding roughshod over us.
155,The BJP will work for restoring the trust and credibility of the Government.
156,We will also ensure that the chain of responsibility and accountability is built in the system.
157,6 Strengthen the Framework Team India Centre-State Relations India is a diverse country.
158,Diverse communities settled in vastly different regions have their own aspirations.
159,"Taking these aspirations into consideration, the centre and the states therefore have to evolve a working system, which leads to harmonious relations."

168,(cid:1) We recognize the special needs and unique problems of the hill and desert states.
169,"In consultation with the Governments of these states, state-specific developmental priorities/ models will be evolved so that the aspirations of the people are met."
170,"(cid:1) Given the unique status of Union Territories (UTs), they will receive special attention."
171,We will focus on developing and strengthening the economy of UTs.
172,"Tourism will be promoted, tribal welfare and their rights will receive full attention, and infrastructure and coastal area development will be given top priority."
173,(cid:1) We reiterate our commitment to the protection and integrated development of our island territories.
174,(cid:1) The moribund forums like 'National Development Council' and 'Inter-State Council' will be revived and made into active bodies.
175,(cid:1) Involve the state Governments in the promotion of foreign trade and commerce.
176,"(cid:1) Help the states mobilize resources through investments in industry, agriculture and infrastructure."
177,"Integrating the Nation - Its Vastness and Voices In a democracy, everyone is not only free, but also encouraged to voice his or her concerns."
178,It is also necessary that these voices be heard and concerns redressed.
179,"However, all this should happen within the framework of our constitution and with the spirit of 'India First'."
180,We have to keep the Nation at the forefront of our thoughts and actions.
181,"Any activity, which disrupts the integrity of the nation, cannot be in the interest of any segment of the society or any region of the country."
182,All Indians living in different regions of the country have an equal stake in the progress of the country and they have to be assured of the fruits of the progress.
183,"(cid:1) Presently, we see that there is a vast regional disparity between different regions of the country 7 along developmental parameters, particularly between the western part and the eastern part."
184,"Despite their richness in both natural as well as human resources, eastern part of India still lags behind."
185,(cid:1) We shall give the highest priority towards bringing the eastern parts of the country on par with the western parts.
186,"To that extent, there shall be special focus and emphasis on the development of the eastern side of India."
187,"(cid:1) Government will play the role of an enabler and a facilitator to the rapid progress of the states; planning along regional aspirations, strengths and potentials, evolving appropriate strategies for various zones of the country - hilly regions, plains, desert and coastal areas."
188,Regional aspirations: BJP has always stood for greater decentralization through smaller States.
189,"Northeast : Resource rich North-Eastern states are lagging behind in development due to poor governance, systemic corruption and poor delivery of public services."
190,NDA government had initiated concrete steps to address the issue of development of Northeast by setting up the Ministry of North- Eastern Region.
191,We will empower this Ministry with a broader charter and non-lapsable funds for the rapid development of the region.
192,BJP will: (cid:1) put special emphasis on enhancing the connectivity within the region and to the rest of the country.
193,"There will be special emphasis on massive infrastructure development, especially along the Line of Actual Control in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim."

199,take measures for the safety of North-Eastern students studying across the country including setting up Hostels for North-Eastern students at various educational centres.

201,"Jammu and Kashmir: Jammu and Kashmir was, is and shall remain an integral part of the Union of India."
202,The territorial integrity of India is inviolable.
203,"BJP will pursue an agenda of equal and rapid development in all the three regions of the state - Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh."

207,"(cid:1) All steps will be taken to provide good governance, better infrastructure, educational opportunities, healthcare and more job opportunities, leading to a better quality of life in the valley."
208,"Seemandhra and Telangana: BJP is committed to do full justice to Seemandhra, and address the 8 issues of development and governance of Seemandhra and Telangana."
209,Decentralization and People's Participation From Representative to Participatory Democracy India is a country of immense diversity - a highly decentralized federal structure is thus crucial in meeting the varied ideas and aspirations of our diverse people.
210,Power is currently concentrated in Delhi and the State capitals.
211,We believe this power should be genuinely decentralized.
212,BJP has stood for greater decentralization through devolving of powers to the states.
213,A vast reservoir of People's Power has not yet been tested in the real sense.
214,We have not been able to involve the people in Governance as functionaries and facilitators.
215,(cid:1) People's Participation: Our developmental process will be a people's movement - of Jan bhagidari.
216,We will make them the active drivers of development rather than mere passive recipients.
217,"(cid:1) People's Engagement: Through Pro-active, Pro-people Good Governance, we will ensure the Government itself directly reaches out to the people, especially the weak and marginalized sections of society."
218,(cid:1) We will further evolve the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model into a People-Public-Private Partnership (PPPP) model.
219,"(cid:1) BJP is committed to strengthen self-Governance at the local level and we will empower Panchayati Raj Institutions with extensive devolution of the 3 Fs - Functions, Functionaries and Funds."
220,(cid:1) Good performers amongst the Panchayats will be rewarded with additional developmental grants.

225,"BJP recognizes the importance of diversity in Indian society, and the strength and vibrancy it adds to the nation."
226,The party believes in the principle of unity in diversity.
227,"India constitutes of all its' people, irrespective of caste, creed, religion or sex."

229,"The hallmark of India is ""Unity in Diversity""."
230,"It constitutes of each and every inch of our land, its natural resources and mental and physical energy we possess."
231,It constitutes of all the institutions made in the past and present.
232,"India First simply means nurturing and protecting all the elements, which India is made of."
233,"It does not exclude anyone or anything - it only includes everything and everyone, which India is made of."
234,"It is complete India; without exclusion, without exception."
235,"It also means that whatever is in the interest of India will be in the interest of all the elements that India is made up of, including its citizens."
236,"The counter to the concept of 'India First' is what is happening today; appeasement of one, at the cost of the other, using Institutions for protecting the interest of a particular party or persons."
237,It is reflected in the thinking that whatever is not in the interest of a party is not in the interest of India.
238,"Clearly, Governance on these lines is not in the interest of India."
239,"Simply speaking, 'India First' puts the national interest first while taking any decision or step both by Governments and citizens."
240,"Even more simply put, you have to just see the face of India and Indians when you are in doubt."
241,This is what separates 'India First' from the present day politics and Governance of the Congress-led UPA.
242,For BJP: (cid:1) the only philosophy and religion of a Government should be India First.
243,(cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) the only epic of a Government should be India's Constitution.
244,the only power of a Government should be the power of the people.
245,the only prayer of a Government should be the welfare of its people.
246,"the only way of a Government should be 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'."
247,Open Government and Accountable Administration Administrative reforms will be a priority for the BJP.
248,"Hence, we propose to implement them through an appropriate body under the PMO."
249,The objective will be to bring in transparency in Government's decision- making process.
250,"Government systems and processes would be relooked to make them citizen friendly, corruption free and accountable."
251,Every effort will be made to meet the development aspirations of the people and make the Government agencies accountable to the citizens.
252,We will set-up an effective Lokpal institution.
253,Corruption at any level will be dealt with firmly and swiftly.
254,"From birth certificate to school admission, from setting up business to paying of taxes, our present systems complicate the lives of our own people."
255,"We will reform it and make it easy in terms of access, efficiency and delivery."
256,Following specific action will be initiated: (cid:1) digitization of Government records will be taken up on top priority so that they are easily accessible.
257,"10 (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) performance review, social and environment audit would be mandated for all Government schemes and programmes."
