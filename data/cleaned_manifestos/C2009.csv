6,Preface Elections to the 15th Lok Sabha are to be held shortly.
7,This is the time for you to choose your government at the Centre.
8,The Indian National Congress respectfully seeks a renewed mandate from the people.
9,"We pledge to continue our work to ensure a life of SECURITY, DIGNITY AND PROSPERITY for every citizen."
10,The Indian National Congress seeks this mandate on the strength of the performance of the Congress-led UPA government during 2004-09.
11,We made promises in our manifesto of 2004.
12,We have delivered on them in a very substantial measure.
13,"The Indian National Congress seeks a fresh mandate on the basis of its core values and ideology — secularism, nationalism, social justice, and economic growth for all, especially for the the aam admi."
14,"We seek a fresh mandate on the basis of our heritage, record of service and vision of the future."
15,"We reaffirm our unflinching commitment to the welfare of all our people, especially to the well-being of the weaker sections of our society."
16,"The Indian National Congress is the only party that appeals to, and derives its strength from, each and every section of our society."
17,"The Indian National Congress is the only party that believes that economic growth and communal harmony, and economic growth and social justice, are two sides of the same coin and must always go hand-in-hand."
18,"The Indian National Congress is the only party that combines experience and youth, wisdom and exuberance, achievement and ambition."
19,II.
20,Why Congress?
21,These are national elections.
22,"While there will be regional, state-level and local issues that are important, these are elections for a government at the Centre, one that will govern all of India in its many diversities and fulfill its multitude of hopes and aspirations."
23,"It is only the Indian National Congress that is anchored in the larger vision of India as a nation, while at the same time being sensitive to regional and local sentiments."
24,"It is only the Indian National Congress that has demonstrated its commitment to a strong Centre, to strong States, and to strong panchayats 3 and nagarpalikas."
25,India’s political system must have space for institutions at each of these three levels.
26,Each has a vital and specific role to play.
27,The Indian National Congress is fighting these elections in alliance with like- minded parties in some States.
28,These parties share the progressive vision and values of the Congress.
29,"Over the past five years, the Indian National Congress has managed a coalition government at the Centre, accommodating the views of its partners but without compromising on any of the essential principles of nation-building."
30,"Even so, what India needs most today -- what every Indian needs most today – at the national level is a party with an All-India perspective and with an All- India presence."
31,The Indian National Congress is the only such party.
32,"The Indian National Congress is the party that, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, led our people into freedom from colonial rule."
33,"It is the party whose leadership, by the admission of Dr. Ambedkar himself, made our Constitution possible."
34,"The Indian National Congress is the party that, under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, established the foundations of the modern Indian nation- state with its abiding commitment to parliamentary democracy, secularism, economic development, and science and technology."
35,"Learning from experience at every step, the Indian National Congress is the party that has responded creatively to the challenges of the times through the establishment of a vast public sector manufacturing base in the fifties; through bank nationalization and the Green and White Revolutions spearheaded by Indira Gandhi in the late-sixties and seventies; through prudent liberalization and the IT Revolution created by Rajiv Gandhi in the eighties; bolder economic reforms in the nineties; and unprecedented economic growth over the past five years."
36,"It is the only party that is forward- looking, the only party that believes a better future is the right of every Indian."
37,"The achievements of India since 1947 are the achievements of its people – of its farmers and farm labour, its organized sector and unorganized sector workers, its managers, its scientists and engineers, its teachers, doctors and other professionals, its entrepreneurs and businesspersons."
38,"It has been the privilege of the Indian National Congress to have provided the political leadership that heralded these accomplishments under the Prime Ministerships of Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Narasimha Rao and Dr. Manmohan Singh."
39,"Congress vs BJP: Secular, Liberal Nationalism vs Narrow Communalism 4 The Indian National Congress has always been in the forefront of the battle against those forces that seek to divide and fragment our society."
40,"The Indian National Congress has always been the bulwark against the four “isms” that threaten to tear our country apart -- communalism of all kinds, linguistic chauvinism, regional parochialism and casteism."
41,"At the national level, the BJP has sought to position itself as the main political rival of the Indian National Congress."
42,The Indian National Congress rejects this presumptuous posturing since the BJP is simply not present in large parts of our country.
43,"Even so, the contest between the Indian National Congress and the BJP is not just a fight between two political parties."
44,"It is, in essence, a clash between two competing visions of Indian nationalism, between two competing visions of what India should be."
45,The Indian National Congress’s secular and liberal nationalism has an equal place for each and every Indian.
46,It is an inclusive vision.
47,The BJP’s narrow and communal nationalism denies equality and equal rights to large sections of our people.
48,It is an exclusionary doctrine.
49,The Indian National Congress’s secular and liberal nationalism is founded on a celebration of India’s many diversities.
50,The BJP’s narrow and communal nationalism rejects many of these diversities and seeks to impose an artificial uniformity on our people.
51,The Indian National Congress practices the politics of consensus and cooperation.
52,The BJP practices the politics of divisiveness and discord.
53,"Instinctively, the Indian National Congress unites, while the BJP divides."
54,"Third Front – a recipe for chaos There is also the so-called Third Front, a grouping of opportunistic parties."
55,These parties have neither consistency nor clarity.
56,They have neither competence nor commitment.
57,"This Front, grounded in the politics of convenience, is nothing but a platform for personal ambitions."
58,It speaks of “alternative polices” without spelling out what these alternatives are.
59,Parties of the Third Front do one thing when they are in power and quite another when they are rejected by the people.
60,"The Left Parties, who are prime movers behind the so-called Third Front, supported the Congress-led UPA government for over four years."
61,They attempted to exercise authority without taking on any responsibility.
62,"At every step, they violated the discipline, restraint and sobriety so very essential for running a coalition smoothly."
63,"At every step, the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, briefed them on all important issues."
64,The Left Parties 5 withdrew their support on the issue of the civilian nuclear agreement even though it had been negotiated and concluded on our own terms.
65,They adamantly refused to listen to reasoned arguments that convincingly demonstrated that the agreement was in India’s supreme national interest.
66,The Left Parties and their present partners pride themselves on being secular.
67,"On the contrary, it may be recalled that they had actively aligned with the BJP in the past."
68,"They are, in fact, responsible for the electoral growth of the BJP."
69,"As past experience has shown, the Third Front is a recipe for political instability."
70,"Lacking a natural national anchor, it is a recipe for chaos, not cohesion."
71,Only a united India can fight terrorism The integrity and security of India are paramount.
72,"Terrorism threatens many countries, including India."
73,Terrorism knows no religion and it respects no political boundary.
74,"It is, as has become painfully evident, not confined to any community or any political persuasion."
75,Its method is the mindless use of violence directed at the innocent in the most cowardly manner.
76,"Let it be very clear — terrorism must be fought relentlessly, intelligently and wisely, and without fear or favour."
77,"Terrorism can be fought only by a united people, not by a people divided by religion."
78,Religious polarization that is intrinsic to the BJP severely erodes our capacity to combat terrorism.
79,"It is only the Indian National Congress that can deal with the scourge of terrorism squarely and decisively but without weakening the delicate strands that have, together, bound our society for centuries."
80,Dealing with terrorism aided and abetted from across our borders does not require a “muscular” foreign policy as advocated by the BJP.
81,"The country knows the heavy price that was paid for such a “muscular” foreign policy— stupor in Kargil, surrender in Kandahar and stalemate in Operation Parakram."
82,"What India needs is an intelligent and wise foreign policy, a foreign policy that is rooted in our traditions, gives us strength through our unity and common purpose, and radiates confidence."
83,"After the November 2008 attacks on Mumbai, the Congress-led UPA government mounted a forceful diplomatic campaign."
84,"It was this campaign that led to Pakistan admitting, for the first time, that Pakistani citizens were 6 responsible for the attacks."
85,That admission was a notable victory for our well thought out foreign policy.
86,The Middle Path – the Congress’s way Balance—or the middle path--has always been the hall-mark of the policies of the Indian National Congress.
87,"As the world experiences a severe recession, it is this balance that is standing India in good stead."
88,"It is a balance between the public sector and the private sector, with an important role assigned to cooperatives and self-help groups."
89,It is a balance between building a modern economy and imparting a new thrust to traditional industries.
90,It is a balance between promoting employment in the organized sector and protecting livelihoods in the unorganized sector.
91,It is a balance between addressing the needs of urban India and improving the quality of life and standard of living in our villages and towns.
92,It is a balance between taking advantage of globalization and ensuring that these benefits flow to local communities.
93,It is a balance between regulation by the government and unleashing the creative spirits of our entrepreneurs and professionals.
94,It is only the Indian National Congress that cherishes and practices this balance in all spheres of our national life including in the conduct of economic and foreign policy.
95,This balance is needed now more than ever.
96,III.

161,Towards faster and more inclusive growth The Indian National Congress is fully aware that the world economy faces the worst crisis in 50 years.
162,This crisis has been caused by a failure of financial markets in the USA and in other developed countries.
163,"However, the Indian economy has shown considerable resilience under the most adverse international circumstances."
164,This is the outcome of the policies of successive Congress governments.
165,"This is the direct result of a vibrant public sector that is the legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru, government ownership of banks that is the legacy of Indira Gandhi, and a strong private sector that matured and flowered during the tenure of Rajiv Gandhi and thereafter."
166,"The average rate of economic growth during the self-declared India Shining period of the BJP was just 5.8% per year, as compared to 8.5% during the five year tenure of the Congress-led UPA government."

176,"Within 45 days of forming the new Government, the Indian National Congress will present the regular Budget for the year 2009-10 with the basic objective of returning to the path of faster and more inclusive growth, which is so essential for fulfilling all our social and economic objectives."

293,The annual allocations to gram panchayats that can be used for purposes designated as priority by the gram sabha will be substantially stepped up.

305,"These clusters, mostly in small and medium towns, will be given 19 access to finance, technology and marketing and will be provided vastly improved infrastructure."
306,"• We will maintain the path of high growth with fiscal prudence and low inflation As the experience of 2004-09 demonstrates so vividly, rapid economic growth creates opportunities for increased government expenditure in vital areas like education, health, agriculture, social security and infrastructure."
307,Average growth in the first four years of the Congress-led UPA government was 9% per year for the first time in our history.

325,"Once GST is implemented, all other central and state-level indirect taxes such as VAT, excise duty, service tax, entertainment tax, luxury tax, etc."

333,• We will offer a new deal to our youth to participate in governance The Indian National Congress has always been the party that has reposed its confidence in youth.

335,The IT revolution that has spread in our country has opened up whole new avenues for our youth.
336,The Indian National Congress will design and launch a voluntary national youth corps which would enable young men and women in the age group of 18-23 to serve up to two years in constructive nation-building activities for which they will be suitably compensated.
337,The Indian National Congress will also make a beginning to induct youth into organs of government.
338,"As a beginning, it will reserve a proportion of seats in panchayats and nagarpalikas for men and women below the age of 35 years without detriment to the existing reservations for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, OBCs and women."
339,The Indian National Congress has periodically renewed itself by inducting young men and women into the Party and entrusting them with responsibilities.
340,"Under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, the Indian National 21 Congress has launched a unique exercise to bring youth from all sections of society and all walks of life into the political mainstream through the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI)."
341,"For the very first time in any political party, there are hundreds of elected youth leaders in Punjab and Uttarakhand."

356,The Indian National Congress is firmly commited to extend full support to the modernization and expansion of our science and technology institutions and will ensure that they attract and retain the best talent from India and abroad.

359,"As a reflection of this priority, the Gram Nyayalaya Act, a key promise of our 2004 Manifesto, was passed by Parliament last year."
360,"Setting up of Gram Nyayalayas at the headquarters of the intermediate panchayats and mobile courts in the rural areas will bring to the aam admi speedy, affordable and substantial justice."
361,• We will continue to be sensitive to regional aspirations The Indian National Congress is aware that in some large states the persistence of intra-regional imbalances in development has given rise to the demand for separate states.
362,"While it has introduced several programmes to redress these disparities, recognising the legitimacy of these concerns and acknowledging that the solution may vary from one state to another, the Indian National Congress will find pragmatic solutions to deal with these demands."
363,• We will ensure energy security for our country The last two years have seen a very sharp turnaround in the addition to power generating capacity.
364,"This momentum will be maintained and it will be ensured that the country adds at least 12,000-15,000 mw of capacity every year through a mix of sources—coal, hydel, nuclear and renewables."

376,"The foreign policy followed in the past five years has yielded handsome results: the foremost example is the agreements on civil nuclear cooperation signed with the USA, Russia, France and Kazakhstan."
377,India’s well-thought out foreign policy and its patient but forceful diplomacy has obliged Pakistan to admit that its citizens were responsible for carrying out the dastardly attacks in Mumbai in November 2008.
378,The Indian National Congress has striven for an enduring peace and for close economic relations with Pakistan.
379,"The Indian National Congress has also encouraged extensive people-to-people contacts between the two countries, particularly amongst the younger generation."
380,But the Mumbai attacks have cast a long shadow on the on-going dialogue and engagement process.
381,It is now entirely upto Pakistan to break the impasse by taking credible action against those responsible for the carnage in Mumbai.
