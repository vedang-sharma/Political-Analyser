69,"not toppled the duly elected Govermnents, of Prakash Singh Badal, not once, not twice, but three times, there would have been no Bindaranwale, no -Blue Star’, no ‘Black Thunder’."
70,"Later, it was the loot and murder of thousands of innocent Sikhs in Delhi and else-where in 1984 that has angered the Sikhs, given a handle to Pakistan and encouraged terrorism."
71,"However, the fact that not all the machinations of Pakistan and not all the provocations of their terrorist agents, has soured Hindu-Sikh relations, is proof positive that the heart of the Punjab is sound."

84,"Here again, BJP will redress legitimate grievances and for the rest, discipline unruly elements and restore order."

95,"In modern times Gandhiji commended ‘Power to the People’ in a ‘structure composed of innumerable villages’ in which there will be ‘ever-widening, never-ending circles."
96,Life will not be a pyramid with apex sustained by the bottom but it will be an oceanic circle whose centre will be the individual.’ Lok Nayak Jaya Prakash Narayan also worked for Panchayati Raj and Deendayalji pleaded for a statutory status for the village Panchayat and the city municipality – in the Constitution.

100,The nation is on the verge of bankruptcy and has been reduced to begging for hand-outs from all and sundry.
101,Indian ambassadors go abroad to beg for loans and even the Prime Minister has to genuflect   3 heads of foreign nations.
102,As a result India’s international rating has sunk to a new low.
103,"India is one of the few countries in the world without a proper government, without a proper budget and without a proper economic policy."
104,"The net result is an upside-down economy in which farmers who produce cotton cannot afford to buy cloth; and masons who put up five-star hotels, have no roofs over their heads."
105,For certain consumer durable there is no dearth of demand.
106,It is estimated that 60 per cent of the consumer durables are purchased by less than 40 cent of the population.

108,"All these trends have to be reversed, and the Bharatiya Janata Party will reverse them."
109,BJP government will ‘ bring out White paper on State of the Economy soon after assuming power.

119,"We have waived the loam of poor agriculturists in Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan."
120,But the Kisan win continue to flounder in poverty unless the burden of people depending on agriculture is reduced.

131,"Over seventy million animals are employed in farming operations in Indian villages, more than eighty percent rural transport needs are met by the bullock-cart."
132,"Cow and its progeny continue to be the major source of power, manure and fuel, including bio-gas."
133,Cow is also an effective protection against environmental degradation.

333,"The people feel sad that through an accident of history this great country should have been saddled with a coterie of small men who are not only incompetent and corrupt, but who lack a sense of commitment to the nation, its democratic institutions and cultural traditions."
334,In the opinion of the BJP a critical moment of history has arrived for India.
335,"The country cannot afford to miss this moment of history, this opportunity to throw out the rulers mainly responsible for this country’s ruination."
336,The BJP on its part has left no stone unturned in its efforts to put up a determined and united electoral battle and has unhesitatingly sacrificed its party interests whenever national interests so demanded.
337,"The Bharatiya Janata Party calls upon the people to join in its struggle for ushering in a new era of hope and prosperity, a value based polity and throw out this corrupt and incompetent Congressmen."
