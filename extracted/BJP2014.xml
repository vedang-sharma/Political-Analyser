India has been credited to have developed, apart from philosophy and mathematics, science and technology of a very high order, which had attracted scholars from all over the world.
Al-Andalusi, a Spanish scholar in the 11th Century, in his monumental work 'Tabaqat al- Umam' had discussed the state of science in different countries.
He writes, "The first nation to have cultivated science is Indiaâ€¦ India is known for wisdom of its people.
Over many centuries all the kings of the past have recognized the ability of Indians in all branches of knowledge."
Andalusi further states, "Indians, as known to all nations for many centuries, are the metal (essence) of wisdom, the source of fairness and objectivity.
They are the people of sublime pensiveness, universal apologues, and useful and rare inventions."
India's contribution to the march of civilization goes back to several thousand years before the Christian era.
From the Vedas to Upanishads and Gautam - the Buddha and Mahavira - the 24th Jain Tirthankara and then to Kautilya and Chandra Gupta and down up to the eighteenth century, India was respected for its flourishing economy, trade, commerce and culture.
It had an international outreach from Korea to Arabia, from Bamiyan to Borobudur and beyond.
Before the advent of Britishers, Indian goods were internationally recognized for their quality and craftsmanship.
India had a much bigger role and presence in industry and manufacturing than any nation in Europe or Asia.
It had a well-developed banking system and equally renowned businessmen, along with its financiers, who were contributing to create a flourishing and progressive economy.
According to Sunderland, India was also one of the greatest shipbuilding nations and consequently had an access to international markets.
Indian prosperity held the world in thrall.
It was this wealth which attracted the foreigners - from Alexander to the Britishers.
Historical records establish the level of progress and prosperity attained by India before the advent of the Europeans.
Indian advancement in mathematics, astronomy, physics and chemistry along with the biological sciences has been well recognized.
India was a land of abundance, prosperity, affluence, a land of sharing and caring living in perfect harmony and peace with the nature.
From ancient times almost all religions practiced in different parts of the world, have existed peacefully in India and will continue to do so.
India thus provides the most ennobling experience in spiritual co-existence.
BJP recognizes that no nation could chart out its domestic or foreign policies unless it has a clear understanding about itself, its history, its roots, its strengths and failings.
In a highly mobile and globalized world, it is imperative for a nation to know its roots that provide sustenance to its people.
\ Indian freedom struggle, which was inspired by Tilak, Gandhi, Aurobindo, Patel, Bose and others, had a clear vision of the civilizational consciousness of India.
These leaders had directed the freedom movement, keeping the Indian ways and thoughts in the centre of their action.
They had a vision to reconstruct the political and economic institutions of India as a continuum of civilizational consciousness, which made India one country, one people, and one Nation.
After achieving independence, the leaders at the helm of affairs lost the spirit and the vision, which the freedom movement had evoked.
They discarded the vision and adopted the institutional framework of administration created by the Britishers which was quite alien to India's world-view.
It is unfortunate that these leaders could not comprehend India's inner vitality, which was the main force responsible for India's survival despite several attacks and prolonged foreign rule and thus, failed to rekindle the spirit of India.
1 Even after nearly seven decades of our independence, the country has not been able to discover its innate vitality, the sense of time and the will to act.
As a result, in spite of being the oldest civilization and a young republic, we are engulfed by a multi-dimensional crisis.
A crisis, which has encompassed all walks of life.
The rising disparities, social and communal divide and terrorism leading to a fractured society, are worsening the situation rapidly.
The present crisis is the result of this confusion and disconnect from the seekings and sensibilities of the people.
This is worse confounded by the weak and spineless leadership of the UPA Government.
The tragedy is further heightened by their failure to diagnose the malady and find the remedy.
Instead of creating a socio-economic and political paradigm of governance drawn from the civilizational consciousness of India, the leaders tried to follow whatever was being practiced in this or that western country.
Thus, we have wasted more than half of a century.
Many other countries, even with smaller size and lesser resources, have surpassed us in development parameters.
Another reason for this is that the Governance in these decades was marred by lack of trust, leading to excessive controls.
It was also marked by lack of openness in Government and lack of people's participation.
This has led to concentration of power in a few hands and lack of transparency breeding corruption and nepotism on a massive scale.
The so-called 'liberalization' came in 1990s, but it was half-hearted.
It didn't work because the rest of the eco-system remained the same.
However, the beginning of the 21st century showed some light under the NDA rule.
India started being reckoned as an economic superpower.
The six-year rule of NDA had given the Nation many firsts, building an image in the International community.
However, many of the hopes, potentials and projects have not been fully realized in the subsequent years.
But after 2004, UPA came into power and the situation started worsening again.
We missed a historic national opportunity once more.
UPA's biggest blow to the Indian political system is that they have taken out Genuineness from Governance; Authenticity from Administration.
UPA has shown Governance of Enactment, not Action.
It has given an Administration of Entitlement without Delivery.
We have become a polity of Promises, and not Performance.
We represent an economy of deficits, a work culture of delays and an asset base of deficiency.
Worse, Congress-led UPA has made India a global synonym of Corruption, Scandal and Stagnation.
To make it even worse, today, we are passing through total Decision and Policy Paralysis.
Sluggish economic growth, unprecedented price rise and unstable Currency are its most visible facets.
The following demand urgent solutions; economy including agriculture, energy, environment including natural resources, education and health, employment, external and internal threats to security, empowerment, Governance, and erosion of moral and societal values.
If India has to survive as a nation, which it has to, in order to play its destined role in the comity of nations, if it has to make its voice heard for creating a peaceful and egalitarian world order, then we must take up the challenges with urgency and determination and provide proper solutions for them.
It is a pity that we have a demoralized leadership presiding over the state apparatus, which is incompetent to handle the present problems.
What is needed today is to arrive at a consensus about the 'Idea' of India and also to think and redesign our approach in consonance with the seekings and preferences of the Indian people.
The situation in the country is deteriorating rapidly.
Delay in resolving the crisis would be dangerous.
What is needed is to take lessons from history, recognise the vitality and resilience of India, the power of its world-view and utilize its strength, which drove it to glorious heights and analyse its weaknesses, which led to this abysmal fall.
Pick up the thread from the point where the continuum of our civilizational 2 consciousness was lost and reorient the polity in consonance with those strong points of Indian psyche which will be the engine for our future glory.
Let's keep the windows open, have a clear understanding of the global scenario and how without destroying our uniqueness we can assimilate the best of the technological advancements.
We can achieve this goal provided the leaders seriously set to this task.
What we need is a political party committed to deliver and a leadership with strong determination and political will.
As Vivekananda had said, "All power is within you.
You can do anything.
Believe in that."
Yes, the power lies in the people of India, in the inner sanctum sanctorum of Mother India.
What is needed is to ignite the spark and Mother India would rise in her full glory.
As Sri Ma had once said that India had become the symbolic representation of all the difficulties of modern mankind but India will also be the land of its resurrection to a higher and truer life.
The BJP will leave no stone unturned to fulfill the dream of 1.22 billion Indians.
Today, India is blessed with the rare capacity and opportunity of Democracy, Demography and Demand.
If we are able to consolidate and harness them, we will be able to reach the heights which India deserves.
The biggest reason for a sorry state of affairs is bad intentions on the part of those who have ruled the country for sixty years.
And that is where we would show the first difference.
For BJP, the goal of the policies and practices would be: Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat!
The path would be: Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
This is our commitment to the Nation and to the People.
With this determination of the party under the charismatic leadership of Shri Narendra Modi, we enter the elections to the 16th Lok Sabha and would work whole-heartedly to give a stable, strong, visionary and progressive Government to India.
It is an opportunity to change our fate and of our nation.
Glory to Mother India, glory to Her children.
Dr. (Prof.) Murli Manohar Joshi Chairman Manifesto Committee -2014 March 26, 2014 3 Attend the Imminent Decade under the UPA - I and II can rightly be summed in one line, the 'Decade of Decay', in which India had a free fall on all fronts - be it governance, economy, diplomacy, foreign policy, border safety, etc.
At the same time, corruption, scams and crime against women have reached to unacceptable levels.
There has been gross misuse and total denigration of government and institutions.
There has also been erosion of authority of the office of the Prime Minister.
The Government dithered by each passing day, casting gloom and doom on the country that was once under the NDA regime called the 'Emerging Superpower'.
In 2004, NDA left the Government with a near double digit growth.
The Congress- led UPA could not even maintain that growth and mismanaged the country so badly, that the growth rate declined to 4.8%, resulting the country falling in a deep mess.
We have lost a wonderful opportunity and have pushed the country 20 years behind and rendered millions of men and women jobless.
Critical and urgent challenges facing the nation have been left unaddressed.
Beyond impacting the immediate short-term, this is corroding the long-term potential of the nation.
People feel frustrated and have lost hope in the system.
Things must change, and they must change now.
BJP will take immediate and decisive action to address these issues on a priority basis.
Price Rise Runaway food inflation has crippled household budgets and contributed to the overall inflationary trend under the Congress-led UPA's watch.
Even worse, the food and nutritional security of millions is threatened.
However, the Congress-led UPA government has remained insensitive and indifferent to the plight of the people; tying itself into knots with short-term, mis-directed steps.
The committee of Chief Ministers, headed by Shri Narendra Modi, has already submitted a report on food inflation in 2011.
The report was unfortunately not acted upon by the Congress-led UPA Government.
The BJP-led NDA Government's record of holding the prices is a demonstration of our commitment to break the vicious cycle of high inflation and high interest rates.
Our immediate task will be to rein in inflation by several steps, such as: (cid:1) put in place strict measures and special Courts to stop hoarding and black marketing.
setting up a Price Stabilisation Fund.
(cid:1) (cid:1) unbundle FCI operations into procurement, storage and distribution for greater efficiency.
(cid:1) leverage on technology to disseminate Real time data, especially to farmers - on production, prices, imports, stocks and overall availability.
evolve a single 'National Agriculture Market'.
promote and support area specific crops and vegetables linked to food habits of the people.
Employment and Entrepreneurship The country has been dragged through 10 years of Jobless Growth by the Congress-led UPA Government.
Under the broader economic revival, BJP will accord high priority to job creation and opportunities for entrepreneurship.
We will: (cid:1) strategically develop high impact domains like Labour-intensive manufacturing (viz.
textile, footwear, electronics assembly, etc.)
and Tourism.
strengthen the traditional employment bases of agriculture and allied industries, and retail - through modernization as well as stronger credit and market linkages.
(cid:1) 4 (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) harness the opportunities provided by the upgradation of infrastructure and housing, for its job generating potential.
encourage and empower our youth for self-employment - incubating entrepreneurship as well as facilitating credit.
address the employability issue by initiating a multi-skills development programme in mission mode.
Focus will be on job creation and entrepreneurship, in both rural and urban areas.
transform our Employment Exchanges into Career Centres - connecting our youth with job opportunities in a transparent and effective manner through the use of technology; as well as providing counselling and training.
Corruption Corruption is a manifestation of poor Governance.
Moreover, it reflects the bad intentions of those sitting in power.
All pervasive corruption under the Congress-led UPA has become a 'National Crisis'.
We will establish a system, which eliminates the scope for corruption.
We will do this through: (cid:1) public awareness (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) technology enabled e-Governance - minimizing the discretion in the citizen-government interface.
system-based, policy-driven governance - making it transparent.
rationalization and simplification of the tax regime - which is currently repulsive for honest tax payers.
simplification of the processes and procedures at all levels - bestowing faith in the citizens, institutions and establishments.
Black Money By minimizing the scope for corruption, we will ensure minimization of the generation of black money.
BJP is committed to initiate the process of tracking down and bringing back black money stashed in foreign banks and offshore accounts.
We will set up a Task Force for this purpose and to recommend amendments to existing laws or enact new laws.
The process of bringing back black money to India what belongs to India, will be put in motion on priority.
We will also proactively engage with foreign Governments to facilitate information sharing on black money.
Decision and Policy Paralysis The country has suffered a decade of maladministration and scams in addition to decision and policy paralysis; thus bringing growth and development to a grinding halt leading to a 'Governance deficit'.
This situation will be changed and the engine of Government will be ignited again with strong willpower and commitment to public interest.
We will also encourage the bureaucracy to take right decisions and contribute their might in building a modern India.
Poor Delivery Wherever we go, we encounter bottlenecks.
We experience it on a daily basis - in government offices for even the simplest of public services, in our courts buried in high pendency and so on.
Similarly, we are known by a culture of missing links and lack of last mile connectivity.
We have water but no pipeline to carry it; we have schools but no teachers; we have computers and machines but no electricity; we have scientists but no labs; we have instruments but no one to work on them.
This 5 reduces the pace of our performance and results into wastage of time, money and energy.
Intent to do the right thing and the will to do things rightly, is missing.
This has to be attended to on a priority basis.
Whatever we do and provide for, the whole chain has to be kept in mind.
With this in mind, we will: (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) remove bottlenecks and missing links in all sectors, activities and services.
focus on proper planning and execution for right outcomes.
strive for scale and speed with futuristic vision.
(cid:1) Build institutions for today and tomorrow.
Credibility Crisis The biggest challenge that India faces today is to restore the credibility of, and trust in the Union Government.
In recent years, the Union Government has lost every semblance of credibility.
Its intentions, integrity and initiatives, all are questionable.
The Congress party has not only lowered the dignity of the Government, but also the dignity of India.
This is what is driving recent adversities like the falling rupee and countries riding roughshod over us.
The BJP will work for restoring the trust and credibility of the Government.
We will also ensure that the chain of responsibility and accountability is built in the system.
6 Strengthen the Framework Team India Centre-State Relations India is a diverse country.
Diverse communities settled in vastly different regions have their own aspirations.
Taking these aspirations into consideration, the centre and the states therefore have to evolve a working system, which leads to harmonious relations.
The genuine grievances of every state will be addressed in a comprehensive manner.
(cid:1) We will place Centre-State relations on an even keel through the process of consultation and strive for harmonious Centre-State relations.
(cid:1) Our Government will be an enabler and facilitator in the rapid progress of states.
We will evolve a model of national development, which is driven by the states.
(cid:1) Team India shall not be limited to the Prime Minister led team sitting in Delhi, but will also include Chief Ministers and other functionaries as equal partners.
(cid:1) Ensure fiscal autonomy of States while urging financial discipline.
(cid:1) Create 'Regional Councils of States', with common problems and concerns, with a view to seeking solutions that are applicable across a group of states.
(cid:1) We will encourage cooperation among states on security-related issues, inter-state disputes and for removing inter-regional economic disparities and promoting tourism.
(cid:1) We recognize the special needs and unique problems of the hill and desert states.
In consultation with the Governments of these states, state-specific developmental priorities/ models will be evolved so that the aspirations of the people are met.
(cid:1) Given the unique status of Union Territories (UTs), they will receive special attention.
We will focus on developing and strengthening the economy of UTs.
Tourism will be promoted, tribal welfare and their rights will receive full attention, and infrastructure and coastal area development will be given top priority.
(cid:1) We reiterate our commitment to the protection and integrated development of our island territories.
(cid:1) The moribund forums like 'National Development Council' and 'Inter-State Council' will be revived and made into active bodies.
(cid:1) Involve the state Governments in the promotion of foreign trade and commerce.
(cid:1) Help the states mobilize resources through investments in industry, agriculture and infrastructure.
Integrating the Nation - Its Vastness and Voices In a democracy, everyone is not only free, but also encouraged to voice his or her concerns.
It is also necessary that these voices be heard and concerns redressed.
However, all this should happen within the framework of our constitution and with the spirit of 'India First'.
We have to keep the Nation at the forefront of our thoughts and actions.
Any activity, which disrupts the integrity of the nation, cannot be in the interest of any segment of the society or any region of the country.
All Indians living in different regions of the country have an equal stake in the progress of the country and they have to be assured of the fruits of the progress.
(cid:1) Presently, we see that there is a vast regional disparity between different regions of the country 7 along developmental parameters, particularly between the western part and the eastern part.
Despite their richness in both natural as well as human resources, eastern part of India still lags behind.
(cid:1) We shall give the highest priority towards bringing the eastern parts of the country on par with the western parts.
To that extent, there shall be special focus and emphasis on the development of the eastern side of India.
(cid:1) Government will play the role of an enabler and a facilitator to the rapid progress of the states; planning along regional aspirations, strengths and potentials, evolving appropriate strategies for various zones of the country - hilly regions, plains, desert and coastal areas.
Regional aspirations: BJP has always stood for greater decentralization through smaller States.
Northeast : Resource rich North-Eastern states are lagging behind in development due to poor governance, systemic corruption and poor delivery of public services.
NDA government had initiated concrete steps to address the issue of development of Northeast by setting up the Ministry of North- Eastern Region.
We will empower this Ministry with a broader charter and non-lapsable funds for the rapid development of the region.
BJP will: (cid:1) put special emphasis on enhancing the connectivity within the region and to the rest of the country.
There will be special emphasis on massive infrastructure development, especially along the Line of Actual Control in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim.
(cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) address the issue of Flood control in Assam and river water management.
nurture more job generating opportunities like tourism and IT industry.
address the issue of infiltration and illegal immigrants in the Northeast region on a priority basis.
This will include clear policy directions and effective control at the ground level.
complete all pending fencing work along the India-Bangladesh and India-Myanmar border, stepping up border security.
take measures for the safety of North-Eastern students studying across the country including setting up Hostels for North-Eastern students at various educational centres.
deal with Insurgent groups with a firm hand.
Jammu and Kashmir: Jammu and Kashmir was, is and shall remain an integral part of the Union of India.
The territorial integrity of India is inviolable.
BJP will pursue an agenda of equal and rapid development in all the three regions of the state - Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.
(cid:1) The return of Kashmiri Pandits to the land of their ancestors with full dignity, security and assured livelihood will figure high on the BJP's agenda.
(cid:1) The long pending problems and demands of refugees from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK) will be addressed.
(cid:1) BJP reiterates its stand on the Article 370, and will discuss this with all stakeholders and remains committed to the abrogation of this article.
(cid:1) All steps will be taken to provide good governance, better infrastructure, educational opportunities, healthcare and more job opportunities, leading to a better quality of life in the valley.
Seemandhra and Telangana: BJP is committed to do full justice to Seemandhra, and address the 8 issues of development and governance of Seemandhra and Telangana.
Decentralization and People's Participation From Representative to Participatory Democracy India is a country of immense diversity - a highly decentralized federal structure is thus crucial in meeting the varied ideas and aspirations of our diverse people.
Power is currently concentrated in Delhi and the State capitals.
We believe this power should be genuinely decentralized.
BJP has stood for greater decentralization through devolving of powers to the states.
A vast reservoir of People's Power has not yet been tested in the real sense.
We have not been able to involve the people in Governance as functionaries and facilitators.
(cid:1) People's Participation: Our developmental process will be a people's movement - of Jan bhagidari.
We will make them the active drivers of development rather than mere passive recipients.
(cid:1) People's Engagement: Through Pro-active, Pro-people Good Governance, we will ensure the Government itself directly reaches out to the people, especially the weak and marginalized sections of society.
(cid:1) We will further evolve the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model into a People-Public-Private Partnership (PPPP) model.
(cid:1) BJP is committed to strengthen self-Governance at the local level and we will empower Panchayati Raj Institutions with extensive devolution of the 3 Fs - Functions, Functionaries and Funds.
(cid:1) Good performers amongst the Panchayats will be rewarded with additional developmental grants.
(cid:1) Strengthen the institution of the Gram Sabha, respecting their inputs and initiatives for development process.
(cid:1) We will actively involve people in policy formulation and evaluation through various platforms.
(cid:1) We will encourage Openness in the Government, involving all stakeholders in the decision-making processes.
9 Reform the System Good Governance: Transparent, Effective, Involving and Encouraging India First BJP believes in India being one country, one people and one nation.
BJP recognizes the importance of diversity in Indian society, and the strength and vibrancy it adds to the nation.
The party believes in the principle of unity in diversity.
India constitutes of all its' people, irrespective of caste, creed, religion or sex.
It constitutes of all the communities - ethnic, social and cultural groups and also our culture, which is defined by tolerance and co-existence.
The hallmark of India is "Unity in Diversity".
It constitutes of each and every inch of our land, its natural resources and mental and physical energy we possess.
It constitutes of all the institutions made in the past and present.
India First simply means nurturing and protecting all the elements, which India is made of.
It does not exclude anyone or anything - it only includes everything and everyone, which India is made of.
It is complete India; without exclusion, without exception.
It also means that whatever is in the interest of India will be in the interest of all the elements that India is made up of, including its citizens.
The counter to the concept of 'India First' is what is happening today; appeasement of one, at the cost of the other, using Institutions for protecting the interest of a particular party or persons.
It is reflected in the thinking that whatever is not in the interest of a party is not in the interest of India.
Clearly, Governance on these lines is not in the interest of India.
Simply speaking, 'India First' puts the national interest first while taking any decision or step both by Governments and citizens.
Even more simply put, you have to just see the face of India and Indians when you are in doubt.
This is what separates 'India First' from the present day politics and Governance of the Congress-led UPA.
For BJP: (cid:1) the only philosophy and religion of a Government should be India First.
(cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) the only epic of a Government should be India's Constitution.
the only power of a Government should be the power of the people.
the only prayer of a Government should be the welfare of its people.
the only way of a Government should be 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'.
Open Government and Accountable Administration Administrative reforms will be a priority for the BJP.
Hence, we propose to implement them through an appropriate body under the PMO.
The objective will be to bring in transparency in Government's decision- making process.
Government systems and processes would be relooked to make them citizen friendly, corruption free and accountable.
Every effort will be made to meet the development aspirations of the people and make the Government agencies accountable to the citizens.
We will set-up an effective Lokpal institution.
Corruption at any level will be dealt with firmly and swiftly.
From birth certificate to school admission, from setting up business to paying of taxes, our present systems complicate the lives of our own people.
We will reform it and make it easy in terms of access, efficiency and delivery.
Following specific action will be initiated: (cid:1) digitization of Government records will be taken up on top priority so that they are easily accessible.
10 (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) performance review, social and environment audit would be mandated for all Government schemes and programmes.
open up Government to draw expertise from the industry, academia and society into the services.
government will be redefined by elimination of whatever is obsolete in laws, regulations, administrative structures, practices and would be purposive.
(cid:1) we will generate 'Kartavya Bhavna' among public servants as lives and productivity of people is dependent on the quality and efficiency of public services.
On the whole, hallmarks of our Governance model would be: (cid:1) People-centric (cid:1) Policy driven (cid:1) Time bound delivery (cid:1) Minimum Government, Maximum Governance E-Governance: Easy, Efficient and Effective BJP believes that IT is a great enabler for empowerment, equity and efficiency.
The NDA Government had made IT one of the major thrust areas.
With the result, India is the IT capital for the whole world.
But back home, the benefits of IT have not percolated down.
This will be a high priority area for BJP that IT touches the lives of ordinary men and women.
BJP has been known for good Governance and e- Governance will become the backbone for good Governance.
BJP aims to nurture a Digital India - making every household and every individual digitally empowered.
Information Technology has made it possible to make information and services reach to the ordinary men and women even in remote areas, easily and effectively.
Availability of information is the key to empowerment of the stakeholders.
This also reduces the scope for discretion and manipulation.
We will: (cid:1) focus on increasing the penetration and usage of broadband across the country.
Deployment of broadband in every village would be a thrust area.
(cid:1) leverage technology for e-Governance and engage proactively with the people through social media for participative governance and effective public grievance redressal mechanism.
(cid:1) generate IT based jobs in rural and semi-urban areas.
(cid:1) make technology enabled products affordable for students.
(cid:1) use technology to reduce the burden of books on children.
Make all institutions and schools e- enabled in a phased manner.
Digital learning and training to be used extensively.
(cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) pursue a mission mode project under the 'National Rural Internet and Technology Mission' for use of telemedicine and mobile healthcare for rural healthcare delivery; use of IT for agriculture for real time information; Self Help Groups; retail trade and SMEs; and rural entrepreneurs, etc.
initiate a National e-Governance Plan to cover every Government office from the centre to the panchayats.
The 'E-Gram, Vishwa Gram' scheme in Gujarat to be implemented nationwide.
promote e-Bhasha - National Mission for the promotion of IT in Indian Languages.
focus to bring SC/ST, OBCs and other weaker sections of the society within the ambit of IT enabled development.
11 (cid:1) (cid:1) deploy IT to protect India's priceless cultural and artistic heritage, which includes digitization of all archives and museology.
promote 'open source' and 'open standard' software.
(cid:1) mandate digitization of all government work to reduce corruption and delays.
(cid:1) set up High-speed digital highways to unite the nation.
(cid:1) (cid:1) use technology to reduce Transmission and distribution losses.
use mobile and e-Banking to ensure financial inclusion.
BJP aims to make every household digitally literate with a goal to make India the Global Knowledge hub, with IT being a major driver and engine of growth.
Institutional Reform - Administrative, Judicial, Police and Electoral (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) Administrative Today, people of this country are frustrated with the present system.
Our administrative set up should be people-centric, responsive and result-oriented.
With this in mind, we are committed to bring the following reforms: (cid:1) the administration and its members will be made truly accountable to their tasks as well as the people through rigorous evaluation process.
good performance will be rewarded; non-performers will be given opportunities and training support to improve.

Due to a lopsided development approach and skewed allocation of resources, they continue to lag behind the rest of the country in socio- economic indicators in spite of having abundant natural resources and talent.

Neo-Middle Class - Meet their Aspirations India has a large middle class with immense understanding, talent and purchasing power.
In addition, a whole new class has emerged.
Those who have risen from the category of poor and are yet to stabilize in the middle class, the 'neo middle class'.
This class needs proactive handholding.
Having moved out of poverty, their aspirations have increased.
They want amenities and services of a certain standard.
They thus now feel that Government facilities and services are not up to the mark, and hence resort to the private sector for things like education, health and transport.
This is obviously costly, putting the neo middle class into a daily dilemma.
As more and more people move into this category, 17 their expectations for better public services have to be met.

In particular attention will be paid on government providing: (cid:1) Educational scholarships and educational facilities.

Through the idea of Rurban, we will bring urban amenities to our rural areas, while retaining the soul of the village.

We also believe that development has to be holistic, uniform and all pervasive.
Further, we have to make the people active partners in whatever is happening and empower them to take advantage of the development process.
We will make an effort that government withdraws from those services which could be done by others and devote that extra time, money and energy for social sectors, particularly for development of the weaker sections.
And a common thread will run across all our ideas and initiatives.
This common thread is the wire and wave of Technology - maximum application of technology for making governance easy, economical and effective.
Social Security - A Caring Government, Passionate Society India has always been a caring society.
It is in our culture to help the aged, the weak and the helpless.
We have to retain this.
We have to educate our younger generations about this.
The social security schemes of the Governments have to be made more meaningful.
Our aspirations get frustrated when we encounter a weak social infrastructure.
We need it on a daily basis.
Children - the Future of the Nation "There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children" - Nelson Mandela Indicators related to children welfare are an indicator of the progress of the nation, be it health, education or safety of children.

Economic Revival When the NDA Government completed its tenure the baton was handed over to the incoming UPA Government with GDP growth nearing double digit in 2004.
Inflation was under control.
Fiscal Deficit and Current Account Deficit were kept within limit and the overall Economy was showing robust fundamentals.
In contrast, now at the end of Congress-led UPA regime, the GDP growth has plummeted to very low of 4.8%, the inflation and price rise beyond control, the fiscal deficit and current account deficit in the alarm zone, and the manufacturing sector facing a recession.
The Congress-led UPA has indulged in massive scams during its last five years.
In recent years, the Indian Rupee has seen a free fall like never before.
This is basically the result of policy and decision paralysis of the UPA Government.
Decisions are simply not taken.
And if they are taken, they turn into scandals.
All this has destroyed the reputation of our economy.
To reverse this process, the first thing, which is required, is to restore confidence in 26 the integrity of the decision-making and sanctity of our decisions.

Flora, Fauna and Environment - Safeguarding Our Tomorrow The present generation has to make this world a better place to live.
A better place not only for us, but for our future generations as well.

Natural & National Resources - Use When Required, Protect Where Necessary Indian belief has been best encapsulated in Gandhiji's words that "there is enough for everyone's need - but not for everyone's greed".
Need is not the issue.
Greed is.
A country's progress depends upon its resources and how they are harnessed and protected.
Those in power have to realize they are just trustees of the resources of the nation.
The resources are neither meant for them nor for their masters.
If we bring this basic shift in thinking of the Government, which Mahatma Gandhi also advocated, all problems will be resolved.
In recent years, it has been noticed that country's tangible and intangible resources have been looted with impunity.
The adverse result is being felt on two sides: Firstly, the proceeds of the resources have not gone to the public exchequer.
Secondly, because of this culture of usurping, the same resources are not available for public purposes.
The management of natural resources is marred with either misappropriation or misallocation.
This has to be set right.
(cid:1) We will set in place national policies on critical natural resources like coal, minerals, spectrum, etc.

Secure Indians - Zero Tolerance on Terrorism, Extremism and Crime Comprehensive national security is not just about borders, but in its broad terms includes military security; economic security; cyber security; energy, food and water and health security; and social cohesion and harmony.
To effectively address the issues of national security, we need to address the issues of - human resources, science and technology, system of governance and money.
National security cannot be compartmentalized based on one of issues but needs a clear roadmap to address it.
Over the past decade, lack of a strong and visionary leadership, coupled with multiple power centres, has failed to address the issue of national security, leading to a chaotic situation and denting India's image in the international arena.
India has a sensitive neighbourhood and there are internal security issues.
There have been intrusions inside the LAC (Line of actual control), loss of squadrons of combat aircraft by the air force, witnessing of a series of accidents by the Navy, leading to a loss in its combating capability built over many decades, communal riots, Maoist attacks, increase in incidence of Pakistan backed terror groups in 37 India, illegal immigration across the eastern border, and racists' attacks in the national capital.
All these are indications of surrendering of India's interest.
This calls for a review and overhauling of the current system.
With the financial situation worsening, the issue of national security can acquire a horrifying dimension.
BJP recognizes the importance of identifying a clear roadmap to address the issue head-on, with radical systemic changes.

Our emphasis was, and remains on, beginning of a new thrust on framing policies that would serve India's national interest in the 21st century.

BJP believes that political stability, progress and peace in the region are essential for south Asia's growth and development.
The Congress-led UPA has failed to establish enduring friendly and cooperative 39 relations with India's neighbours.
India's relations with traditional allies have turned cold.
India and its neighbours have drifted apart.
Instead of clarity, we have seen confusion.
The absence of statecraft has never been felt so acutely as today.
India is seen to be floundering, whereas it should have been engaging with the world with confidence.
The collapse of the Indian economy has contributed to the sorry state of foreign affairs in no small measure.
We will build a strong, self-reliant and self-confident India, regaining its rightful place in the comity of nations.
In this, we will be firstly guided by our centuries old tradition of olq/kSo dqVqEcde~.
At the same time, our foreign policy will be based on best National interests.
We will create a web of allies to mutually further our interests.
We will leverage all our resources and people to play a greater role on the international high table.

India has always played a major role in world affairs, offering a lot to the World.
This has been its tradition since time immemorial.
The magnetic power of India has always been in its ancient wisdom and heritage, elucidating principles like harmony and equity.
This continues to be equally relevant to the world today in today's times of Soft power.
We will adopt Proactive Diplomacy to spread the same.
India was reckoned not only as Vishwaguru but also a vibrant trading society.

This was based on the strength of our business acumen and integrity, our products and crafts.
The symbols of our ancient civilizations stand as a testimony to our architectural and urban planning excellence.
We will revive Brand India with the help of our strengths of 5 T's: Tradition, Talent, Tourism, Trade and Technology.

These facts will be taken into consideration while taking any decision on 'Sethu- Samudram Channel' project.
Ganga: River Ganga is a symbol of faith in India, and has a special place in the Indian psyche.
It is Mukti dayini.
In addition it is also Jivan dayini for the parts of the country it flows.
People and cattle depend on it for agriculture, fodder and drinking water.
Pure water of the Ganga are thus essential for the spiritual as well as physical well being of India.
Unfortunately however, even after decades of independence, the Ganga continues to be polluted and is drying.
BJP commits to ensure the cleanliness, purity and uninterrupted flow of the Ganga on priority.
In addition, a massive 'Clean Rivers Programme' will be launched across the country driven by people's participation.
