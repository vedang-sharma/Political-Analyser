2 / 3 Foreword by Rahul Gandhi 121 PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS 24 STATES AND 3 UNION TERRITORIES IN OVER 60 LOCATIONS 53 SESSIONS WITH FARMERS, TEACHERS, ENTREPRENEURS, DOCTORS, LAWYERS AND ECONOMISTS 12 COUNTRIES FROM WHERE NRIs WERE REPRESENTED Elections 2019 present a stark choice to the people of India.
Will India be a free and democratic country and will the Indian people be free from fear, free to live and work and pray and eat and love and marry according to their wishes, free from poverty and free to pursue their ambitions?
Or will India be governed by a perni- cious ideology that will trample upon people’s rights, institutions, conventions and the healthy differences that are the essence of a multi-cultural country?
Will India be able to lift all our people with the tide of growth and will it get rid of poverty or will India become a country marked by gross inequalities of income, wealth and power?
The last 5 years have been disastrous for the people of India.
Youth have lost jobs.
Farmers have lost hope.
Traders have lost business.
Micro, small and medium enterprises have lost their confidence.
Women have lost a sense of security.
Deprived communities have lost their traditional rights.
Institutions have lost independence.
The harshest blow is that our citizens have lost their faith in the words of the Prime Minister and his Government.
He has given us only grandiose promises, empty slogans, failed programmes, false statistics and an overall climate of fear, intimidation and hatred.
In this time of deep crisis, the Indian National Congress promises a clean break from the past 5 years.
With this manifesto, the Congress offers to you the only national alternative: a distinct alterna- tive that is unwavering in its commitment to truth, freedom, dignity, self-respect and prosperity for our people.
We promise to make India strong and united, and a just and prosperous society.
Our manifesto process reflects our commitment to a higher vision, that of listening to the Jan Awaaz.
It is not the ‘mann ki baat’ of one individual but the collective voice of lakhs of people.
We have used all possible tools—website, WhatsApp, email, online petitions, and meetings with citizens, experts, stakeholders and grassroots activists.
Between October 2018 and February 2019, many of you engaged in a conversation with the Congress, in at least 16 languages, through the medium most easily available to you.
Our Manifesto Committee organised 121 consultations with the public and 53 consultations with experts such as farmers, entre- preneurs, economists, students, teachers, women’s groups, doctors, lawyers and many others.
We held consultations in over 60 locations across 24 States and 3 Union Territories.
We also met with NRI repre- sentatives from over 12 countries.
I have personally been listening to our people’s voices from all corners of our country.
Every single word in the Congress manifesto reflects your voices and the aspirations of crores of Indians.
It is an action plan for the future of India.
You inspired this manifesto.
It is a living manifesto.
Now, it needs your support and your vote.
We will present a report to the people of India, every year, on the status of implementation of our mani- festo.
We will also set up an independent social audit group, which will make its own assessment of how and to what extent we have fulfilled our promises.
This is our commitment.
Congress promises.
Congress delivers.
Rahul Gandhi President, Indian National Congress 4 Foreword by Rahul Gandhi / 5 / 5 The Choice Before You The 2019 general elections will be held during Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary year.
This reminds us that these elections are mainly between 2 ideologies.
On the one hand is the Indian National Congress which has worked tirelessly to “wipe every tear from every eye,” while building a strong, har- monious, prosperous and modern India.
On the other hand is the ideology of the RSS and its affiliates, which is working to destroy the very idea of India that the Mahatma gave his life for.
Over the last 5 years of the BJP government, India has suffered under the ‘Modi model,’ which has devastated our economy, impoverished our farmers, destroyed jobs, divided communities, stoked hatred and spread fear.
It is a model that has stripped the average Indian of dignity, voice and trust.
This is not the model India deserves.
This is a model that all Indians must reject.
The Congress model is in stark contrast to the BJP model.
The Congress has always provided transfor- mative development, inclusive growth, responsive governance and reforms that strengthen the foundations of our Republic.
The 2019 elections are crucial for India’s future and our children’s future.
The choices before our citizens are crystal clear.
Do we choose freedom or fear?
Do we choose harmony or hatred?
Do we choose inclusion or exclusion?
Do we choose dignity or oppression?
Do we choose prosperity for all or wealth for a few?
Do we choose results or jumlas?
Do we choose justice or injustice?
Our allies and other progressive political parties across the country recognise the importance of this moment.
We have, therefore, come together to defeat the BJP-led coalition and set our nation on the right course.
In this Manifesto, we present to you the only national alternative—the Indian National Congress.
Why Congress Again?
Our record speaks for itself.
We have delivered prosperity for the people of India before.
We will do it again!
Ahead of us lies an electoral battle that will decide the fate of our nation for decades to come.
India has faced many such grave challenges before.
The Indian National Congress has been at the forefront of many such battles, and India has always triumphed.
Congress led and won India’s struggle for freedom.
We established and nurtured parliamentary democra- cy.
We led India to adopt a visionary Constitution that ushered in peaceful socio-economic transformation, established institutions that safeguarded our Repub- lic, and provided the nation its moral compass that has stood the test of time.
On the other hand, under the BJP government, every independent institution has suffered an unprecedented loss of credibility.
Congress will restore India’s faith in our institutions and Constitution.
We have done it before.
We will do it again!
Congress built a modern India marked by prosper- ity and productivity.
We built the IITs, IIMs, AIIMSs, CSIR institutions and laboratories, and educational and scientific research institutions that harnessed the brilliance of Indian minds and talent.
Congress ushered in the Green Revolution and the White Rev- olution that transformed lives in rural India.
We built the public sector that was the foundation upon which industrialisation and technological progress reached commanding heights.
We made India a nuclear and space power.
We led the Electronics and Telecom Revolutions and made India a global leader in Infor- mation Technology.
On the other hand, the BJP government has ensured that farm prices are at a 10-year low, credit growth is at a 20-year low and unemployment is at a 45-year high.
Exports and investment are at histor- ical lows, projects are stalling at an increasing rate, and factory closures have led to a stagnating manu- facturing sector.
Digital India, Startup India and Make in India have been colossal failures.
Petrol, diesel and gas prices have sky-rocketed.
Consumers are in despair and have lost confidence in the government.
Farmers are under extreme stress and have lost hope.
An aspirational India has become a desperate India.
Congress will once again bring India on track to be among the leading economies of the world in the 21st Century.
We have delivered before.
We will do it again!
Congress launched liberalisation and economic reforms.
It is the Congress that created India’s successful middle class and the new entrepreneurial class.
It is the Congress that passed rights-based legislation and created a social safety net for the very poor.
It is the Congress-led UPA government that lifted an unprecedented 14 crore Indians out of poverty between 2004 and 2014.
On the other hand, Mr. Modi, arbitrarily and single- handedly, devastated India’s economy through demonetisation.
It cost the people of India at least ₹ 4 lakh crores in lost output, lakhs of jobs and greater indebtedness.
Then, a poorly designed GST was implemented in a hasty and careless manner, with rules being changed haphazardly almost every day.
Arbitrary powers given to authorities brought back the ‘Inspector Raj.’ Tax terrorism has crushed the animal spirits of our entrepreneurs.
Together, these moves have destroyed the lives and livelihoods of farmers, traders, small business owners and work- ers in the unorganised sector.
Congress will ensure that the excesses and mistakes of the past 5 years are reversed.
We will usher in an economy that works for all and we will ensure that no one is left behind.
We have delivered before.
We will do it again!
Do we choose inclusion or exclusion?
Do we choose prosperity for all or wealth for a few?
Do we choose results or jumlas?
Do we choose justice or injustice?
6 The Choice Before You / 7 / 7 Inspired by the slogan ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan,’ the Congress government led India to victory in the 1965 war with Pakistan.
In 1971, we decisively defeated Pakistan and liberated Bangladesh.
We crushed secessionist forces, healed differ- ences, and ensured the unity and integration of our people.
Congress leaders Mahatma Gandhi, Smt.
Indira Gandhi, Shri Rajiv Gandhi and Shri Beant Singh made the ultimate sacrifice for India.
On the other hand, the BJP Government’s policies have been based on the whim of one man, sidelining the Ministry of Ex- ternal Affairs and the entire diplomatic corps.
The BJP Govern- ment is solely responsible for cancelling the gains made under the UPA years, the widening of fault lines, the total alienation of the people of Jammu & Kashmir, and a worsening of the security situation in that State.
Pseudo-nationalism is on the rise and the success of the armed forces is politicised.
The BJP Government’s political boasts have come even as the defence budget, as a percentage of GDP, has been reduced to its lowest levels in 50 years.
The Congress will once again restore the pride of our armed forces, insulate them from politics, entrust the conduct of foreign policy to professional diplomats and strengthen India’s hard power.
We have delivered before.
We will do it again!
8 The Choice Before You / 9 / 9 Detailed Plan of Action Kaam— Employment and Growth Our pledge is jobs, jobs, jobs.
Congress will fill all 4 lakh Central Government and institutional vacancies before March 2020, create an estimated 10 lakh seva mitra positions in every gram panchayat and urban local body, launch a ‘Water Bodies Restoration Mission’ and ‘Wasteland Regeneration Mission’ to create 1 crore jobs, exempt new businesses from applicable laws and regulations (except Minimum Wages Act and tax laws) for a period of 3 years, encourage State Governments to fill their vacancies, reward businesses for job creation, provide businesses with fiscal incentives for employing more women, and require businesses with over 100 employees to start an apprenticeship programme.
10 10 11 / 11 01 Jobs Unemployment is the gravest challenge to the country and job creation is the highest priority for the economy.
In the last 5 years, there has been a dramatic rise in unemployment.
Today, unemployment is touching a 45-year high of 6.1 per cent according to the government’s own figures.
The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy puts the number at 7.2 per cent.
At the end of this February, 3.1 crore people were actively looking for jobs.
Data indicates that total employment has declined, the labour participation rate has declined and existing jobs have been destroyed.
Every section of society has been affected by growing unemployment and the destruction of existing jobs: youth, families, women, small business persons, traders, farmers, daily-wage workers and agricultural labourers.
Congress pledges to give the highest priority to protecting existing jobs and creating new jobs.
In order to underline the link between the growth of the industry and services sectors and rapid cre- ation of jobs, Congress will create a new Ministry of Industry, Services and Employment.
All of the 4 lakh vacancies as on 1 April 2019 in the Central Government, Central Public Sector Enterprises, Judiciary and Parliament will be filled before the end of March 2020.
As a condition for devolution of funds to the healthcare and educa- tion sectors and to Panchayats and Municipalities, Congress will request State Governments to fill all vacancies, estimated at 20 lakh, in the 2 sectors and in local bodies.
We will work with State Governments to create new Seva Mitra positions (estimated at 10 lakh) in every Gram Panchayat and every Urban Local Body to ensure the effective delivery of govern- ment services to citizens.
Application fees for government examinations and government posts will be abolished.
Congress pledges to create lakhs of new jobs for qualified teachers, doctors, nurses, paramedics, technicians, instructors and administrators through a massive expansion of the education and health sectors.
Para-state workers such as Anganwadi workers, ASHA workers, rozgarsahayaks, preraks, and anude- shaks, form the backbone of the public service delivery system.
We will increase funding for the relevant programmes and work with State Govern- ments to ensure that all arrears are paid imme- diately.
We will also work with State Governments and attempt to address all pending contentious issues regarding their salaries and work conditions.
In addition, we will expand the ASHA programme and appoint a second ASHA worker in all villages with a population exceeding 2500 persons.
We will trigger rapid growth of the manufac- turing sector, particularly of MSMEs, through the provision of world-class infrastructure in industrial hubs and cluster towns in order to aid the expan- sion of current units and the creation of new units.
MSMEs account for 90 per cent of all employment outside agriculture.
The definition of MSMEs based on capital employed is biased against labour.
Congress will link the definition of MSME to employment.
A business employing 10 persons or less will be ‘micro;’ between 11 and 100 will be ‘small;’ and between 101 and 500 will be ‘medium.’ We will create an Enterprise Support Agency to help entrepreneurs, including start-ups, with all-round business support including counselling, incubation, access to technology, funding, domestic and export markets, and the creation of new prod- ucts, services and intellectual property.
We promise regulatory forbearance for Micro and Small Enterprises.
They will be exempt from all applicable laws and regulations (except the Minimum Wages Act and tax laws) for a period of 3 years from 1 April 2019 or, in the case of new businesses, the date of commencement of business.
This means freedom from ‘Inspector Raj’ until they stabilise.
Congress will promote ‘Mass Entrepreneurship’ and support entrepreneurs to replicate tried and tested models of businesses in order to meet the growing demand for such goods and services.
The main job-creating sectors are construction, textiles, leather, gems & jewellery, entertainment, tourism and retail businesses.
We will reward businesses that create new jobs by lowering the effective direct tax rates and by lowering contributions to the CSR fund.
We will provide fiscal incentives to businesses that employ a certain percentage of women.
Exports create jobs.
We will reward export- oriented industries through tax rebates and incentives.
Tourism creates jobs.
Congress promises an ade- quately capitalised Tourism Development Bank to provide low-cost, long-term funds for invest- ment in tourism-related businesses.
We will also offer lower rates of corporate and personal income tax on tourism-related business income.
We recognise the need to create lakhs of low- skilled jobs in order to absorb young men and women who have completed only a few years in school.
Congress will launch 2 major programmes to be implemented through Gram Sabhas and urban local bodies that will create 1 crore jobs: a.
Repair and restoration of water bodies (‘Water Bodies Restoration Mission’); and b. Regeneration and afforestation of wasteland and degraded land (‘Wasteland Regeneration Mission’).
Congress will require businesses employing 100 persons or more to start an apprenticeship programme, impart skills, pay a stipend, and employ from among the trained apprentices whenever a job is created or becomes vacant in that business.
We will amend The Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Rules, 2014 to include ‘Apprenticeship’ as an additional activity.
We will identify new kinds of jobs that will emerge with the advent of new technologies and will offer opportunities to youth to acquire the skill-sets necessary for these jobs.
02 Industry Congress initiated liberalisation in 1991 with a new Industrial Policy.
Taking note of the changes in the global economy and the Indian economy, Congress promises another radical, forward-looking Industrial Policy.
The BJP Government mouths empty slogans.
Its record is dismal in terms of the growth rate of Industry sector GVA and gross capital formation in the Industry sector.
Congress promises to reverse these disappointing trends.
Congress promises to increase the share of India’s manufacturing sector from the current level of 16 per cent of GDP to 25 per cent within a period of 5 years and to make India a manufac- turing hub for the world.
Congress believes that anything that can be made in another country can be made in India.
Congress promises that it will adopt policies, formulate rules, levy taxes and reward entrepreneurship that will make India a renowned centre of manufacturing.
Congress will work with State Governments to set up New Industrial Towns with the required infra- structure and turn them into manufacturing hubs for a variety of industrial products.
We will announce policies that will help India retain its leading position in the manufacture of engineering goods, petroleum products, gems & jewellery, drugs & pharmaceuticals, garments & textiles and chemicals.
We will announce policies that will help India gain a leadership position in steel, metals, cement, machinery, electronic goods, computer hardware, automobiles etc.
Congress will announce a ‘Make for the World’ policy under which foreign and Indian companies will be invited to invest in ‘Exclusive Export-only Zones’, manufacture and export their entire pro- duction, pay no indirect taxes and pay a low rate of corporate tax.
As the UPA did from 2004 to 2014, we will make a determined effort to revive stalled projects and bring locked-up capital to use and generate employment.
We will promote the manufacture and export of India’s traditional products like handloom prod- ucts and handicrafts that employ lakhs of persons.
Congress will acquire patents, create a patent pool and make advanced technologies available to small and medium businesses.
Controls have crept into the system in the name of regulations.
Congress promises to do a quick review of the rules and regulations made by the BJP Government in the last 5 years and repeal as many of them as are necessary to free industry and business from the ‘Control Raj.’ In the last 5 years, tax authorities have been given extraordinary discretionary powers that have throttled industry and come to be described as ‘tax terrorism.’ Investigative agencies have mis- interpreted the laws and have instilled fear among businesspersons.
Congress will review these discretionary powers and arbitrary actions and take steps to allow industry and business to function with a large degree of freedom.
12 Kaam– Employment and Growth / 13 / 13 03 Infrastructure A basic weakness of the Indian economy has been infrastructure.
Flawed design, inefficient execution, insufficient capacity and poor maintenance of infrastructure have dragged India’s growth rate down.
Congress promises to address these deficiencies with a combination of planning, technology, quality and accountability.
All available models and instrumentalities will be used to build infrastructure—public sector, private sector and public-private partnership.
Roads, railway and electricity are among vital infrastructure.
They are also crucial public goods.
Congress promises to augment the total length of national highways and increase the pace of construction.
The focus will be on improved design and quality, maintenance and accountability.
Congress promises to massively modernise all outdated railway infrastructure.
New projects will be implemented in accordance with the best international standards of design and quality.
Road construction and railways can be built using private capital and capacity.
Congress will use sector-specific, tried and tested PPP models to increase the supply of these vital public goods.
Congress promises to review, re-formulate and implement the policy on spectrum and on ex- ploration and extraction of natural resources.
The policy will address issues of allocation, capital investment, enhanced production, transparency, efficiency, risk-reward concerns, environmental sus- tainability, inter-generational equity, accountability, competition and appropriate sectoral regulation.
We will formulate a policy on Clean Energy in existing power plants that use fossil fuels and pro- mote Green Energy to enhance the share of solar and wind energy in the total supply of energy.
Congress promises to enhance availability of, and access to, electricity in rural areas by encour- aging investment in off-grid renewable power generation with ownership and revenues vesting in local bodies.
Every village and every home will be electrified in the true sense.
In the long term, we aim to substitute LPG used in homes by electricity and solar energy.
04 Cities, Urbanisation and Urban Policy India is fast urbanising.
Nearly 34 per cent of our population lives in towns and cities and the number is growing.
As in the rest of the world, India’s cities can become engines of growth.
The Smart Cities Mission of the BJP government, which replaced the successful JNNURM, was a colossal failure and a waste of money with no visible results.
Congress promises to formulate a comprehensive policy on Urbanisation after wide consultation.
We will address the issues concerning towns and cities including city governance, livelihoods, housing, habitat, pollution, climate change, urban transport and disaster management.
Congress will support State Governments to build new towns and cities as well as satellite towns.
Congress will introduce a new model of governance for towns and cities through a directly elected mayor with a fixed term of 5 years, an elected Council and a separate administrative structure for each urban body.
The administration will be ac- countable to the Mayor and the Council and there will be a provision to recruit technical experts and build capacity as well as multi-disciplinary teams to do urban planning and implement municipal works.
We will enforce the 74th Amendment to the Constitution and ensure the devolution of powers, functions and funds to the Municipalities and Cor- porations, making them financially independent.
Congress promises the Right to Housing for the urban poor and protection from arbitrary eviction.
We will build night shelters for the homeless so that no one will sleep in the open.
Congress will launch a Slum Upgradation and Transformation Scheme to ensure basic services such as drinking water, electricity and sanitation to slum dwellers.
Slums will be transformed by replacing huts and kuchha dwellings with proper houses, roads and other public facilities.
Public spaces, public transport, public premises and other public facilities in towns and cities will be made safe for women, children, persons with disabilities, migrants and marginalised sections of society.
More women will be appointed to govern- ment and municipal jobs in towns and cities.
Congress promises to formulate and implement a policy on urban transport with emphasis on met- ro rail, suburban rail, electric vehicles, public bus transport, hired vehicles and shared vehicles.
We will encourage non-motorised transport, namely, walking and cycling.
05 Rural Development Congress promises to enhance infrastructure in rural areas and improve the quality of public goods such as roads, bridges, water supply, sanitation, electricity and schools.
In order to fill the gaps in sector-specific schemes as well correct any unintended bias, we will empower Panchayats and Municipalities to design and execute infrastructure projects.
Congress promises to establish a non-lapsable Rural Infrastructure Fund that will provide loans and grants to specific infrastructure projects undertaken by Panchayats and Municipalities.
We will launch MGNREGA 3.0 to address issues of water security, soil quality and similar issues that aggravate farmers’ distress.
To this end, we will: a.
Increase the guaranteed days of employment up to 150 days in cases where 100 days have been achieved in a block/district; b.
Use MGNREGA labour in the Waterbodies Resto- ration Mission and the Wasteland Regeneration Mission; and c. Use MGNREGA funds to build public assets such as primary health centres, classrooms, libraries etc.
Congress promises to connect all villages and habitations with a population of 250 with a road under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.
Broadband connectivity will be provided to all village Panchayats by the year 2021.
The allocation to the National Drinking Water Mission that has suffered neglect under the BJP government will be increased.
We will pass the Right to Homestead Act to provide a homestead for every household that does not own a home or own land on which a house may be built.
06 Informal and Unorganised Sector Congress promises a fair deal for the crores of workers and the self-employed who toil every day in the unorganised and informal sector.
We will encourage and support micro and Congress promises to establish Aajeevika small enterprises that collectivise unorganised sector workers including waste pickers and scrap collectors.
Congress will ensure that notified minimum wag- es are paid to workers in the unorganised sector.
Congress will ratify ILO Convention 87 (Freedom of Association) and ILO Convention 98 (Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining).
Kendras (Livelihood Centres) in all major cities and towns where a migrant worker may register himself/herself in order to: a.
Access government services; b.
Access basic healthcare; c. Access crèches and schools for his or her children; d. Access skill development and training The Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and centres; and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014 will be implemented in letter and spirit.
Congress will guarantee portability for the ration card possessed by a migrant worker and right to access ration articles at the place of work.
e. Access legal services.
14 Kaam– Employment and Growth / 15 / 15 Daam— An Economy That Works For All To ensure that no Indian is left behind, Congress will provide a Minimum Income Support Programme (MISP) or Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY) under which ₹ 72,000 a year will be transferred to the poorest 20 per cent families in India.
We will provide special respite to farmers and farm workers, not just through “Karz Maafi” or a loan waiver but by setting farmers on the path to “Karz Mukti,” or Freedom from Indebtedness.
07 Agriculture, Farmers and Farm Labour Many years ago, Jawaharlal Nehru said, ‘Everything can wait but not agriculture.’ In the last 5 years, under the BJP Government, the agriculture sector has been driven into deep crisis.
Adequate MSP was denied for 4 years; the procurement machinery was non-existent or weak; debt of farmers mounted; prices of inputs increased steadily; credit was inadequate; demonetisation devastated the cash-based agricultural economy; co-operative credit societies and apex co-operative banks were denied the right to convert their deposits, thereby choking co-operative credit to the farmer; the terms of trade moved decisively against agriculture; the crop insurance scheme robbed the farmer and enriched the insurance companies; and with little or no support from the government farmers and farm labourers were left to fend for themselves.
Congress has heard the cry of anguish of farmers and feels the pain of their acute distress.
Immediately after forming the governments in Congress promises to work with State Governments Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, as promised, the 3 Congress Governments waived the loans of farmers.
Congress promises to waive the outstanding farm loans in other States as well.
We will not stop with just providing “Karz Maafi” or a loan waiver.
Through a combination of remu- nerative prices, lower input costs, and assured access to institutional credit, we will set our Kisans on the path to “Karz Mukti,” or Freedom from Indebtedness.
Debt is a civil liability and we will not allow criminal proceedings to be instituted against a farmer who is unable to pay his/her debt.
In order to ensure priority to the issues affecting the agriculture sector, we will present a separate “Kisan Budget.” Congress promises to establish a permanent National Commission on Agricultural Devel- opment and Planning consisting of farmers, agricultural scientists and agricultural economists to examine and advise the government on how to make agriculture viable, competitive and remuner- ative.
The recommendations of the Commission shall be ordinarily binding on the government.
The Commission will subsume the existing Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices and recommend appropriate minimum support prices.
Congress also promises to establish a Commission on Marginal Farmers and Agricultural Labour to advise on policies and programmes that will help them earn income from higher wages and from non-crop based agriculture such as horticul- ture and floriculture, dairying and poultry.
We will completely re-design the BJP government’s failed Fasal Bima Yojana (Crop Insurance Scheme) that has only enriched the insurance companies at the cost of the farmers.
We will direct insurance companies to offer crop insurance and charge premiums on the principle of ‘no profit, no loss.’ to digitise land ownership and land tenancy records and, in particular, recognise ownership and tenancy rights of women farmers and ensure women get the benefits of agriculture- related schemes.
Congress will promote Farmer Producer Compa- nies/Organisations to enable farmers to access inputs, technology and markets.
We will review the prices of agricultural inputs, extend subsidies where necessary, and establish facilities to hire farm machinery.
Congress will repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committees Act and make trade in agricultural produce—including exports and inter-state trade—free from all restrictions.
We will establish farmers’ markets with adequate infrastructure and support in large villages and small towns to enable the farmer to bring his/her produce and freely market the same.
Congress will formulate a policy on export and import of agricultural products that will support farmers and Farmer Producer Companies/Organisa- tions and enhance their income.
Congress promises to formulate a policy to enable the construction of modern warehouses, cold storage and food processing facilities in every block of the country.
We will revive, strengthen and improve the old system of ‘Agricultural Extension Services’ and bring the best knowledge and best practices to every agricultural holding in the country.
Congress will encourage farmers to diversify into the production of local varieties of millets and pulses that can be procured for the PDS, Mid-Day Meals Scheme and the ICDS programme.
Congress promises a major programme to promote horticulture, pisciculture and sericulture for diversification and greater income for farmers.
We will launch a national project to double the value of production in 5 years in dairying and poultry.
16 16 Daam—An Economy That Works For All / 17 / 17 Congress will promote organic farming, encour- age farmers to use mixed fertilizers and pesticides, support verification of organic products, and help them secure better prices for organic products.
Congress promises to double the funding in 5 years for teaching, R&D, agriculture-related pure sciences and applied science and technol- ogy in the agricultural sector.
We will establish a College of Agriculture and a College of Veterinary Sciences in every district of the country.
Congress promises that the distortions that have crept into the text and the implementation of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Reset- tlement Act, 2013 and the Forest Rights Act, 2006 will be removed and the original purposes of the Acts restored and enforced.
The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 belongs to the age of controls.
Congress promises to replace the Act by an enabling law that can be invoked only in the case of emergencies.
Building on past experience, Congress will re-design MGNREGA and provide for: a.
Increasing the guaranteed days of employment up to 150 days in cases where 100 days have been achieved in a block/district; b.
Use of labour in the Waterbodies Restoration and the Wasteland Regeneration Missions; c. Building village-level assets such as primary health centres, classrooms, libraries etc.
08 Economic Policy India is a developing country aspiring to be a middle-income country by the year 2030.
Wealth creation and the welfare of our people are our 2 principal goals.
Congress economic philosophy is based on embracing the idea of an open and liberal market economy, creation of wealth, sustainable development, reduction of inequalities and assurance of welfare of all sections of the people.
Such growth will be driven by the private sector and a viable public sector and underpinned by a robust system of social security.
Our economy is still over-regulated.
Structural problems remain.
Government control and bureaucratic interference are aplenty.
Regulators have morphed into controllers.
There is growing interference by the courts in economic policies.
The BJP Government has reversed the clock of reforms.
Congress promises to undo these distortions and restore an open, liberal market economy.
18 Fiscal stability is the starting point.
Congress promises to reverse the BJP Government’s fiddling with the target of fiscal deficit.
Congress promis- es to achieve the target of 3 per cent of GDP by 2020-21 and remain under that limit.
The revenue deficit will be contained, as far as possible, under 1 per cent of GDP.
Off-Budget and extra-Budget borrowings will be faithfully reported with the jus- tification for such debt and the means of servicing and repaying such debt.
Monetary policy is the province of the Reserve Bank of India.
Congress promises to reverse the unwarranted and illegal interference by the BJP government into the functioning of the RBI.
Congress will respect the autonomy of the RBI in matters reserved to the RBI under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1939, including the formulation of monetary policy.
However, the Governor shall pe- riodically render an account to a committee of Par- liament.
Congress promises that the government will work closely with the RBI to ensure that fiscal policy and monetary policy are aligned to achieve the common goal of growth with price stability.
Sustained economic growth is the path toward creating wealth.
Millions of people produce goods and services and they must have a large degree of freedom, unfettered by excessive regulations.
Congress will provide a conducive policy climate that will recognise the contributions of the pri- vate sector and the public sector, promote entre- preneurship, encourage innovation, and employ advanced technology and reward risk-taking.
We are the party that first declared the criticality of high and sustained economic growth mea- sured by GDP.
Congress reiterates its firm belief in a high rate of growth of GDP.
Hence, the 4 drivers of economic growth are important and the Con- gress wishes to state its position on each of these: a.
Private Investment: In an open, market econo- my, the private sector must play the lead role in identifying opportunities, mobilising resources, adopting advanced technology, producing goods and services, and securing domestic and foreign markets.
Congress promises to extend full support to the private sector and to revive the animal spirits of our entrepreneurs.
b.
Government Expenditure: Government expen- diture must play a lead role in the creation and provision of public goods.
Congress promises adequate expenditure on roads, railways, waterways, drinking water, sanitation, healthcare, education, national and internal security.
c. Domestic Consumption: In a developing country, rise in consumption is a sign of healthy economic growth.
It is important that the poorer sections of our people consume more.
Supply of goods and services must be abundant and prices must be reasonably stable.
Congress will repose faith in the trading community and create a policy environment that will encourage domestic consumption.
d. Exports: No country has achieved high eco- nomic growth without high growth of exports.
An example is India during the Congress period from 2004 to 2014.
Congress will adopt a policy on foreign trade that will ensure that exports become, once again, a key driver of economic growth.
Congress promises to encourage saving, especially household saving, through suitable rewards for savers.
Savings provide the resources for invest- ment.
Our goal will be to achieve a savings level of 40 per cent of GDP and a Gross Capital For- mation level of 35 per cent of GDP.
We will work with banks and insurance companies to introduce simple financial products for households.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) plays a crucial part in development.
FDI will be welcomed in all sectors, subject to exceptions on the ground of national security.
Rules and regulations will be minimal.
FDI will be accorded national treatment and there will be a level playing field for foreign and domestic investors.
There will be no expropria- tion and no retrospective taxation.
Investments have to be prudently distributed among the different sectors—agriculture and allied activities, industry, and services with special emphasis on education and healthcare.
Congress believes in the crucial role played by market in allocation of resources.
Where it is absolutely necessary, there will be policy intervention to prevent misallocation of resources.
Congress promises to review all laws, rules and regulations governing investments within 3 months.
Instruments that are inconsistent with a market economy or outdated or obstructionist will be repealed.
Foreign Trade Policy will be reviewed and restat- ed within 3 months.
Exports and imports shall be free and consistent with WTO rules.
Any instrument that has the effect of altering this guiding principle will be supported by sufficient justification and its operation will be limited to a sunset date.
Every sector of the economy needs credit.
A ro- bust and healthy banking system, supplemented by non-banking finance companies, is critical to delivery of credit.
While the RBI is the regulator of banks and NBFCs, the government has the respon- sibility to ensure that there is adequate liquidity, cash in circulation and flow of credit.
The BJP Government denied adequate credit to MSMEs, agriculture, trade and exports.
They created the Daam—An Economy That Works For All / 19 / 19 NPA scare that brought lending to a virtual halt.
A one-size-fits-all approach drove companies into insolvency.
Demonetisation shut out all sources of informal credit.
The result is that the agriculture sector is in acute distress, MSMEs are shut or struggling to survive, trade is paralysed, and the volume of merchandise exports was flat for 4 years.
Congress promises to reverse these gross distortions and, working closely with the RBI, re-start the process of credit delivery and ensure sufficient liquidity and cash in circulation.
India must increase the share of manufacturing from the current level of 16 per cent to 25 per- cent in a period of 5 years.
Congress believes that anything that can be made in another country can be made in India.
Congress promises that it will adopt policies, formulate rules, levy taxes and reward entrepreneurship that will make India a global hub of manufacturing.
Congress recognises that business—be it manufac- turing or supply or trade or exports—runs best on predictable and stable laws, protection of property rights and sanctity of contracts.
Congress promis- es to enact and enforce a comprehensive Law on Doing Business in India that will incorporate the best business practices and rules.
We will endeavor to bring every Fortune 500 company to set up a business in India.
Congress promises to encourage and incentivise starting of new businesses.
The Angel Tax imposed on Start-Ups will be withdrawn completely.
We will make India an innovation hub.
MSMEs were badly hit by demonetisation and a flawed GST.
Congress promises to devise a rehabilitation plan for MSMEs that were severely affected and help them revive and grow.
Congress promises to disinvest from non-core, non-strategic central public sector enterprises.
Congress promises good and competent gover- nance.
The capacity of the traditional bureaucracy to deliver on our economic goals has been inade- quate.
We promise to induct into the administra- tion good economic policy makers and managers and give them a large degree of autonomy to design and implement policies that will advance the economic goals of the government.
Unless we are vigilant, government has a tendency to interfere with markets as well as re-acquire control over trade, industry and business.
Gov- ernment has a role in an open and liberal market economy and it is worthwhile to state the Congress position on the role of government: a.
We must get government out of gratuitous interventions in the market; b.
We must get government into addressing notable market failures through regulation (e.g.
capital market, banking, etc.
); and c. We must build capacity in government to do the things it must do (e.g.
taxation, delivery of public goods and services, etc.)
Congress is conscious that while much has been achieved since liberalisation in 1991, there is much more to be done.
Between 2004 and 2014, 14 crore people were lifted out of poverty.
That task has to be continued with renewed vigour.
Congress promises that between 2019 and 2024, another 10 crore people will be lifted out of pov- erty and the ground will be prepared to wipe out poverty—and ensure that no one is left behind— by 2030.
09 Minimum Income Support Programme or Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY) The abolition of poverty remains the foremost goal of the Congress.
We recall with pride that the Congress-led UPA government lifted 14 crore people out of poverty between 2004 and 2014.
It is true that rapid and broad-based growth will reduce poverty and, in the medium to long term, eliminate poverty.
On the other hand, decisive and focused intervention has the capac- ity to eliminate poverty within a decade.
Congress, therefore, sets the goal of elimination of abject poverty by the year 2030.
Congress believes that the size of India’s GDP and the level of Total Expenditure (Central and State Governments) allow us to undertake an ambitious programme of cash transfer to the poorest sec- tions of the people without in anyway affecting the goal of fiscal prudence.
The main features of the Minimum Income Support Programme (MISP) or Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY) will be: a.
The target population will be 5 crore families who constitute the poorest 20 per cent of all families.
They will be the beneficiaries of MISP or NYAY; b.
Each family will be guaranteed a cash transfer of ₹ 72,000 a year; c. As far as possible, the money will be transferred to the account of a woman of the family who has a bank account or who will be urged to open a bank account; d. There will a Design phase (3 months) followed by a Pilot and Testing phase (6–9 months) before roll-out; e. The rollout will be implemented in phases; f. The estimated cost will be <1 per cent of GDP in Year 1 and <2 per cent of GDP in Year 2 and thereafter.
g. As the nominal GDP grows and families move out of poverty, the cost will decline as a propor- tion of GDP.
Congress will appoint an independent panel of eminent economists, social scientists and statisticians to oversee the design, testing, roll- out and implementation of the programme.
The programme will move from one stage to the other only after a ‘go ahead’ from the panel.
Congress intends to implement NYAY as a joint scheme of the Central and State Governments.
The scheme will be funded through new revenues and rationalisation of expenditure.
Current merit sub- sidy schemes that are intended to achieve specific objectives will be continued.
The Congress goal is that ‘No Indian Family Shall Be Left Behind.’ To eliminate abject poverty by 2030, Congress will introduce Nyuntam Aay Yojana to provide ₹ 72,000 a year to the poorest 20 per cent families in India.
10 Taxation and Tax Reforms The 2 major taxes that will be the backbone of the economy are Income Tax and Goods and Services Tax.
Congress reiterates its firm belief that the principles underlying these taxes should be simplicity, transparency and progressivity.
Besides, a good tax administration must place trust in, and enjoy the trust of, taxpayers.
Congress will put an end to the tax terrorism unleashed by the BJP government that has put uncertainty and fear in the minds of individuals and businesses.
Direct Taxes Code Congress promises to enact the Direct Taxes Code in the first year of our government.
It will usher in an era of simplicity, transparency, tax equity, easy compliance and impartial administration.
Congress promises that the Direct Taxes Code will levy taxes at reasonable and progres- sive rates having regard to the level of current incomes, income inequalities and the principles of tax equity.
20 Daam—An Economy That Works For All / 21 / 21 11 Banking and Financial Sector Congress affirms its belief in a competitive banking and financial sector.
The BJP government has considerably weakened the banking sector in the last 5 years; there has been a sharp rise in non-performing assets; crony capitalism has thrived; and deserving sectors and individuals have been denied credit.
Congress promises to reverse these developments.
Congress promises a comprehensive review of the concept, role and functions of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) in order to make PSBs robust and competitive with healthy balance sheets.
Congress will amalgamate 2 or more PSBs so that there will be only 6-8 PSBs with a national presence and reach.
Each of the amalgamated PSBs will be adequately capitalised.
We will undertake a comprehensive review of the governance structure of PSBs and implement changes to make the PSB an independent com- mercial banking organisation that is competitive, healthy, efficient and profitable.
We will abolish the redundant Banking Board Bureau.
Congress promises that PSBs will continue to im- plement policies to serve the larger public interest including lending to priority and other disad- vantaged sectors that are denied adequate credit.
We are concerned by the recent failure of some NBFCs that has affected the bond market, mutual funds and the flow of credit.
Congress promises to review and strengthen the regulatory regime of NBFCs in order to prevent such failures and to restore investor confidence.
We will take the necessary policy and administra- up to global size and standards.
Congress will set up an India Global Companies Fund and create a policy environment to support Indian- owned companies to become global companies.

Goods & Services Tax 2.0 Congress promises to review and replace the current GST laws with the GST 2.0 regime that will truly reflect the intent and purpose of a non-cascading, value-added, indirect tax.
The GST 2.0 regime will be based on a single, moderate, standard rate of tax on all goods and services.
The rate will be revenue neutral to the current indirect tax revenues of the Central and State Governments and will take note of the potential of GST 2.0 to boost their tax revenues.
The GST 2.0 regime will levy a special rate of duty on demerit goods.
GST 2.0 will be easy to administer, easy to understand by the taxpayer, and easy to comply with.

Prosecution under DTC and GST 2.0 will be only in cases of criminal conspiracy or corruption or fraud.

16 Foreign Policy India’s foreign policy was profoundly influenced by the freedom movement and was devel- oped through the collective wisdom of far-sighted leaders.
