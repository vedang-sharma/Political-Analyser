1,"It was thrust upon the country by a motley combination that put political negativism, narrow personal interests and greed for power far above the national good."
2,The Government led by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee lost the vote in the Lok Sabha on April 17 by just one and that too questionable vote.
3,"In spite of promising a new government ‘in five minutes’ and futilely attempting widespread defections, this negative coalition by the Congress failed to come up with any alternative arrangement, forcing the dissolution of the Lok Sabha and fresh elections."
4,"A serving, performing Government was needlessly destabilised."
5,"Hardly had the country absorbed the shock of this avoidable uncertainty, then we were faced by Pakistani armed intrusion Kargil."
6,The Government rose to the challenge and acted decisively.
7,"Faced by this aggression in Kargil, the response of the Government was swift, though measured."
8,The last of the Pakistani intruders were cleared from the Kargil Sector on 27th July.
9,"We salute the heroism, dedication and selflessness of our armed forces."
10,We dedicate ourselves anew to preserving the honour and territorial integrity of our motherland.
11,"We reiterate our commitment to look after the welfare of the armed forces, and of the dependents of all those that laid down their lives in service of our motherland."
12,The security of the nation is our paramount duty.
13,In fulfillment of this sacred duty we will ensure that the neglect of defence preparedness by the previous governments during the last decade shall be corrected.
14,The defence of India and the needs of our armed forces is our commitment.
15,"1 This General Election allows the country a great opportunity of finally putting an end to the era of political negativism, uncertainty and dynasticism."
16,"In this hour of national challenge, when the faith of the people in democratic institutions is under test it is vital that all nationalist forces join hands."
17,"This is the moment to look ahead, to a new, resurgent India."
18,"In Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the country has a leader who blends tradition with modernity, a leader who understands India and the world and a statesman who is accepted by all sections of the country."
19,"In just 13 months, the Vajpayee Government set new parameters of purposeful governance."
20,"In the realms of national security, regional cooperation, economic modernization and centre-state relations, the Vajpayee Government has shown the way forward."
21,Under Shri Vajpayee’s leadership the National Democratic Alliance seeks a firm and resounding mandate to complete the unfinished agenda.
22,The National Agenda for Governance of the National Democratic Alliance constitutes the basis of our joint commitment for a stable Government to take India into the new millennium.
23,"On this occasion we appeal for a new political age of reconciliation and accord based on our principled commitment to: • National Security – ensuring full combat effectiveness of our armed forces; • National Reconstruction – an end to divisiveness and a moratorium on contentious issues; • Dynamic diplomacy – In service of motherland to obtain for India it’s rightful place in the comity of nations; • Federal harmony ensuring a partnership of the Centre and States; • Economic Modernization – harnessing technology for rapid, equitable growth; • Secularism – the emotional harmony of all Indians and full protection of minorities; • Social justice – empowerment of all weaker sections and gender rights; • Probity – transparency of decision-making and corruption- free governance; When the whole nation was thrown into the vortex of political   instability because of the toppling of the Government headed by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, by the irresponsible combination of Congress, the left parties and their old and new found allies; when the whole nation felt that it was duped and deceived by their chicanery because they could not fulfill their boast of an alternative Government in ‘five minutes’ – even for several days; and when the whole nation was on the verge of loosing faith in our democratic system was getting cynical about politics and politicians; the signatory political parties came together as an act of national commitment and founded the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), under the leadership of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to set the Indian polity on a new course for the future."
24,"The reason for creating the NDA is to lift the spirit of the nation at large, to draw its people together and, most importantly, to rebuild the bonds of common purpose that are the very roots of our democratic polity."
25,The NDA came into being because of an historic need and realisation amongst us that our young democracy cannot bear the fits and tremors of frequent elections which will undermine the peoples’ faith in the democratic process.
26,"Therefore, with a consensus on a common cause and a common set of principles we have sunk our differences to weld ourselves into a solid phalanx of a single dominant political formation and thereby we fulfill the resolve of the Indian people to give themselves a stable, strong and progressive Government."
27,"We are proud that the NDA is representative of both national interests and regional aspirations – after all the NDA is nothing but the mirror-image of our nation’s unity in multifaceted diversity, rich pluralism and federalism."
28,   1 Our Mission The NDA’s mission in politics is to build a bond of trust between Government and people.
29,This is the only way a democracy can flourish; but unfortunately has been ignored during the last 50 years of one-party rule.
30,"Therefore, the NDA pledges to the people of India a Government which shares their hopes and anxieties and which will work as partner with all people irrespective of class, caste and religion – not just with a privileged few."
31,This is our contract with the people.
32,The NDA is new; the NDA is the future and the NDA is a broad- based movement for progress and justice.
33,Our vision is one of national renewal with modern programmes of change for a resurgent India.
34,We reach out to the minorities and even at the cost of repetition proclaim that we will safeguard the rights as enshrined in our Constitution.
35,NDA is the political arm of none other than the Indian people as a whole.
36,No one will be cast aside; fairness and justice will be rendered to one and all and we assure you that there will not be any discrimination.
37,"We appeal to our brothers and sisters of the minorities that we whole-heartedly extend our hands of friendship, in these fraternal words: Let us hold hands and walk together to build a resurgent, modern India."
38,Let us throw away our old prejudices.
39,Let us put an end to divisiveness.
40,Let us have a moratorium on contentious issues.
41,Let us bind ourselves with bonds of trust and friendship.
42,"We want an India which we all feel part of, in whose future we all have a stake."
43,And we want to enter the new millennium with confidence; not with divisive feelings.
44,This is our call for reconciliation and it is part of our commitment to the minorities.

52,Swadeshi is not reinventing the wheel.
53,It means that we will facilitate the domestic industry to gain enough muscles to compete with the multinationals in the local and global markets.
54,We want domestic companies to flourish   and acquire a Trans National status.
55,"At the same time the country cannot do without FDI because besides capital stock it brings with it technology, new market practices and most importantly employment."
56,Our target is to achieve at least $10 billion per year which will commensurate with our growth objectives.

61,"It is about better society, about improving the way citizens can demand and obtain all sorts of public goods."
62,It is about dignity for all.
63,"We firmly resolve that poverty should be relegated to history like slavery, colonialism, small pox and cholera and we should meet the challenge of mobilising resources for that by undertaking the challenge of restructuring priorities and mainstreaming these priorities into new programmes of pro-poor growth and redistribution towards poverty eradication -That is how we plan to eradicate absolute poverty within this generation - within the first decades of 21st century – and we strongly feel that it is feasible and affordable, infact, it is a moral imperative which we will not miss."
