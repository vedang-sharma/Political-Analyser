
The open ManifesTo proCess: paThbreaking poliTiCal reforM The	Indian	National	Congress	has	pioneered	an	entirely	new	way	in	which political	party	election	manifestos	are	prepared.
It	is	our	firm	belief that	the Indian	National	Congress	Manifesto	must	reflect	the	voice	and	aspirations	of the	people	and	a	new	vision	for	the	country.
There	were	several	consultations	held	across	the	country	over	a	five-month period	(from	October,	2013	to	March,	2014)	with	different	stakeholders,	to get	their	inputs	on	India’s	future	growth,	development	and	inclusion	agenda.
The	Congress	Vice	President	Shri	Rahul	Gandhi	participated	in	several	of these	interactions	including	those	with	representatives	from	Scheduled	Castes, Scheduled	Tribes,	Other	Backward	Classes,	minorities,	women	organisations, youth,	labour,	industry,	Panchayat	representatives,	ex-servicemen,	railway porters,	rickshaw	pullers,	salt-pan	workers	and	farmers.
In	addition	to	this	a dedicated	website	(www.incmanifesto.in)	was	established	to	invite	suggestions from	all	citizens	for	the	Manifesto.
A	separate	website	for	the	“National	Student Manifesto”	was	also	created.
We	received	tens	of thousands	of suggestions	through	these	consultations,	on the	websites	and	social	media	platforms,	phones,	emails,	etc.
These	suggestions were	carefully	considered	and	have	been	included,	wherever	feasible.
We	believe	this	unique	exercise	has	made	the	Manifesto	inclusive	and	fully reflective	of the	voice	of the	people	of India.

communal harmony, and economic growth and	social	justice,	are	two	sides	of the	same coin	and	must	always	go	hand-in-hand.
The Indian National Congress is the only Party that combines experience and youth, wisdom and exuberance, achievement and ambition.
The	Indian	National	Congress	seeks	a	renewed mandate on the strength of its heritage, its record	of service,	both	in	and	out	of power, and	its	clear	vision	for	the	future.
We envision an India charting a new future rather than rewriting in harmony, not in turmoil; thriving in peace its past; living to The Indian National Congress has made India’s unity, seminal contributions integrity, secular polity and democratic federalism.
We have championed the rights of the	weaker	sections,	created	conditions	for faster economic growth and have been the principal	instrument	of social	and	economic change, the preferred political choice for crores of women and men.
Our	central	values	resonate	the	very	idea	of India,	that	has	come	to	us	over	the	centuries, an India that rejoices in and celebrates its many diversities, and builds on these diversities to strengthen the bonds of unity through secularism, pluralism, inclusion and social	justice.

In the 1980’s, economic reforms were launched in response to new challenges, to The depth and breadth of its political and administrative experience makes the Indian National Congress most intrinsically aware and closely associated with the beliefs, and principles	and	need	of the	people	of India.
We are the Party that has always believed in the idealism and leadership abilities of the youth.
We have remained connected with their aspirations and have been inspired by their	restless	vibrancy.

The Party has worked to realise almost all the	promises	made	to	the	people	in	its	earlier Manifestos	and	campaigns: The Indian National Congress led the charge to enact a unique and unprecedented law to safeguard food security for the poorest.
The National Food	Security	Act	marked	the	realisation of over	a	decade	of work	and	has	been hailed as a visionary law	by	the	people.
of The seminal Right to Compensation Fair in and Transparency Acquisition, Land and Rehabilitation Resettlement Act, 2013	-	a	key	campaign promise the Indian	National	Congress	in	2009	-	was enacted after two years of nationwide consultations.
This law was a historic victory for our brothers and sisters working in the agriculture sector.
The law	ensures	that	land	cannot	be	acquired without land owners consent, promises	up	to	four	times	the	prevailing market	value	as	compensation	and	repeals the	Land	Acquisition	Act	of 1894. the The	Indian	National	Congress	led	the	way in bringing about historic reform with regard to women’s rights in the form of the	Criminal	Law	(Amendment)	Bill,	2013 and the salutary Protection of Women from	Sexual	Harassment	at	Workplace	Act, 2013.
These laws made the system more sensitive to the challenges faced by our women.
Penalties	have	increased	and	new crimes	were	included	to	make	the	definition more	women	friendly	so	that	the	law	better serves	the	interests	of the	aggrieved.
In a bid to bring greater clarity on the subject, the Congress-led UPA Government enacted a new Companies Act, 2013.
This new law, resulting from comprehensive consultations with all stakeholders	brings	about	radical	changes that will stimulate entrepreneurship, make it easier to start new businesses and Lokayukta Act, 2013 was born out of a determination to give the people a strong, independent authority to act as a watchdog against administrative corruption.

12 13 a new future for the hands that build the nation It	is	because	of the	Indian	National	Congress that employees in the organised sector have been fully protected through legislation and are entitled to social security in different ways.
While organised sector employment must expand, the reality is that employment in	the	unorganised	sector	contributes	close	to 94%	of India’s	labour	force.
In recent years, with the expansion of employment opportunities because of rapid economic	growth,	this	segment	has	expanded.
In recognition of this, in 2008, the Congress-led UPA government	passed the Unorganised Social Workers’ Security	Act,	2008.
The Indian National Congress believes that it is time to scale up these programmes across the country so that all workers	derive	benefits	from	both	legislation and programmes in the next five years.
To ensure a basic rights and welfare package for all working people, the Indian National Congress	will	ensure: Enforcement	of Minimum	Wage	laws; Provision	of Pension	cover; Provision of life and disability cover, health and maternity benefits – free medicine, old age protection, Provident Fund, injury benefit, housing,	education	schemes	for	children, and	old	age	homes; employment Creation	of a	working	environment	that enables all such workers to carry out work without harassment.

We also propose that there should be a minimum tariff protection	so	that	there	is	an	incentive	to manufacture goods in India rather than import	them	into	India.
The Indian National Congress’s agenda is one of social and economic transformation.
Growth is essential for this transformation to	happen	and	for	it	to	be	truly	meaningful.
It is economic growth that creates jobs for our youth.
It is economic growth that gives us	the	resources	to	invest	in	our	social	welfare programmes	and	infrastructure	development.
The nature and quality of growth is equally important	to	ensure	that	the	gains	of growth are	equitably	distributed.
Over	the	last	ten	years,	the	Congress-led	UPA governments have pursued and delivered rapid and inclusive economic growth.
We have	delivered	economic	growth	of 7.5	%	per However, given the economic slowdown in the last few years, driven by the global financial crisis, bringing India back on track to achieve 8% inclusive growth will be an overriding priority of the next Congress-led government.
An	Economic	Roadmap	for	2014-2019 The Finance Minister in his budget speech earlier	this	year	has	laid	out	a	roadmap	of ten important	tasks	to	be	undertaken	by	the	next government.
The Indian National Congress affirms its commitment to this roadmap which	is	outlined	below: i.
Fiscal	Consolidation:	We	will	achieve	the target of fiscal deficit of 3 % of Gross 14 15 vi.
Financial Sector Reforms: The the Financial recommendations of Sector Legislative Reforms Commission that	require	no	change	in	legislation	must be	implemented	immediately	and,	for	the other	recommendations,	we	must	draw	a timetable	for	passing	legislation.
vii.
Subsidies: Given the limited resources, and the many claims on the resources, we must choose the subsidies that are absolutely	necessary	and	give	them	only to the absolutely deserving.
We will also consider introducing sensible user charges because many more people are willing	to	pay	for	better	quality	services, for example, uninterrupted power and better quality train services.
We will use money this saved to expand health, education and infrastructure.
viii.
Urbanisation: cities become Our will ungovernable, and perhaps unlivable, if we	do	not	address	the	decay	in	our	cities.
Cities have wealth, cities also create wealth.
That	wealth	should	be	tapped	for resources	to	rebuild	the	cities	with	a	new model	of governance.
ix.
Skill Development: Skill development must	rank	alongside	secondary	education, university	education,	total	sanitation	and universal health care in the priorities of the	government.
x.
Sharing responsibility between States and Centre:	States	have	the	fiscal	space	to	bear	a reasonable	proportion	of the	financial	costs of implementing	flagship	programmes	and must willingly do so, so that the Central government can allocate more resources for subjects such as defence, railways, national	highways	and	telecommunications that	are	its	exclusive	responsibility.
The	Indian	National	Congress’s 100	Day	Agenda	for	Growth While the above presents a medium-term agenda	for	reform,	the	immediate	priority	is to	ensure	that	the	economy	gets	back	on	track to	the	target	of 8	%	growth.
